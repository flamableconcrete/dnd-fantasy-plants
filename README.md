# D&D Fantasy Plants

From this post on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7rb6rj/i_have_put_countless_hours_into_a_roughly_175

I wanted to be able to programmatically work with the plant entries to create a better interface/pdf for them. Here it is so far!

# TODO
* Use the issue tracker
* ~Parse original 1.5 .docx file into JSON~
* Handle unicode/pretty formatted quotes better
* Handle the oddball plant entries better
  * There are 4? of them
* Actually spit out a .docx file?
* Manually create pdf?
* Create a Homebrewery file?
  * Work in progress: http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Hym27DBLM
