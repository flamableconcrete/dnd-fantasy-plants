> If you can, please support B. Simon Smith, his guide is only $5.95 for the PDF version and has some stuff I didn’t include as well as more lore, backstory, and a kick-ass alchemy system for playing with legitimate preparation of the herbs in question. It’s pretty cheap and he put a lot of work in.

# Scavenging Rules
Magical plants can be found in many different terrains, but that doesn't mean that adventurers automatically can identify what is around them. The DM would select a table below based on the abundance (or lack thereof) of plants in the adventurer's environment. A player who wishes to scavenge for plants may make a nature check. 10-14 is mildly successful, 15-19 is successful, 20+ is very successful. This would mean that for a mild success, roll on the table with disadvantage, for a success, roll on the table to see what kind of plant you get, and for very successful roll with advantage.

In most cases, 100 will also count as Very Rare, since Legendary plants should only be in one or two places around the world, so make sure the setting is right to get a Legendary plant.

### Aadarna
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A tough plant that grows on the edges of swamps, the stem grows symmetrical pairs of stiff oval leaves. During warmer months the plant blossoms into violet flowers. The large roots of the plant can be ground into a powder and is the main ingredient in a potion that allows other people to see into other realms, often referred to as Sight Beyond. For the next hour after drinking, the vision of the character shifts to the Astral Realm. They may perceive what happens from a position that corresponds to their location in the Material Realm. During that time, they are blind to everything that happens in the Material Realm, including combat.



### Abyssal Blackgrass
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Thick black weed native to the Underdark that propagates via tiny seeds. On the surface it appears as 1-foot diamater clumps, but its roots extend in a 50 ft diamater just beneath the surface. Natural healing is prevented when standing above its roots, and magical healing only heals half the normal HP. If the clump is pulled out, the plant survives and regrows the clump in 1d4 days. Only digging up the whole root system or the use of a Blight-type spell can truly kill it. Has taint-mechanic boosting effects.



### Acacia Tree
*[Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A tall tree growing in warmer plain environments with large, sharp thorns on the branches and small, oval shaped leaves. The acacia has long been associated with rituals surrounding the burying and preservation of the dead, and as well as in rituals designed to contact and speak with the dead. If acacia is combined with a solution of melted iron and poured into the hand of a person who is has recently died, the time period in which Raise Dead works is increased to a period of 30 days instead of 10.



### Acai Berries
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Small, blue berries that grow in bunches on tall pines in tropical forests and beaches. The berries have been used for several hundred years in wine and preparation of food in times of plague. The berries grant resistance to catching most kinds of disease and can help in the curing of disease.




\columnbreak

### Adamant Algae
*[Ocean](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Rare algae that grows in water gathered around adamantine. Produces dark red liquid that doubles natural healing rate for 24 hours (requires 1 ounce per 100 lb of body weight) meaning that hit points regained from expended hit dice during a short rest are doubled and the amount of hit dice recovered during a long rest is doubled. Typical pool contains 32 ounces of the liquid, which becomes useless 30 minutes after removal from the pool unless stored in an adamantine vial (200 gp), which makes it last for 1 month. 



### Adder's Tongue
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

The herb has one leaf which grows from a stalk about three inches from the ground. Its appearance gives it its name. The leaf must be boiled in olive oil and set in the sun for three days. At the end of that time the infusion can be used as a balm for wounds. In the event that the wound is infected the balm will draw out the infection within one day. However, for that one day the damage caused by the infection will be twice as severe, infection damage can be determined by the DM.

### Adgana
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

The leaves of this plant must be dried. They may then be crushed and eaten. Its effects diminish with constant use.

The third time it is used it adds 1 to Strength and Dexterity for the same amount of time, the 4th time +1 is added to Strength only, and after that no benefit is ever gained. In addition to this, the herb is also highly addictive, meaning that after the first and second used, the user must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or become addicted. This DC increases by +1 for each additional use, and addiction causes a -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until next consumption of Adgana.

After the bark reaches a certain age it begins to crack and peel away from the trunk. If the dark grey bark is boiled in water for three hours, then dried and crushed, it creates a powder that completely neutralizes the flavor and odor of anything blended with the bark as it is crushed, possibly making the plant appropriate for use with poisons or perhaps just bad tasting food.

While the vines are a deep shade of green, the leaves are an odd shade of blue. Drying the leaves and then smoking them provides the smoker a sense of euphoria and calmness that lasts for 1d4+4 minutes. However, smoking the leaves is often addicting, and requires a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw each time to avoid becoming addicted to the feeling of euphoria that the leaves bring. Withdrawal from Azure Leaves includes a heightened sense of paranoia, meaning a -4 penalty to Wisdom or Intelligence saves against fear until the next consumption.




### Balm

### Balon's Plant
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Growing close to the ground in areas with minimal water, the plant only sprouts a trio of wide, thick leaves which spread outward to absorb as much moisture as possible and provide as much shade to the sandy soil below as possible. Below the sand the root system delves deep to find hidden reservoirs of water that are not evident on the surface. Also known as “bread of the desert”, this plant develops large spherical fruits nearly the size of a man’s head. These fruits have a tough and leathery exterior, but when cut open, the fruit has the consistency of fluffy bread or cake. The seeds of the fruit are quite small. Each fruit contains enough nutrients to sustain four people for a day. Unfortunately, farming the plant seems to be near impossible. The seeds must be within a medium-size creature when it dies, at which point the release of certain gasses causes the seeds to mature and greedily absorb as much moisture and nutrients from the corpse as possible. This rich bounty allows the plant to develop a strong root system.

### Betrayer's Inception
*[Other](#p112)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Other](#p112)

Smelling slightly of evergreen needles and camphor before its application, this poison is a thin liquid that is prepared via complicated alchemical procedures and unknown plant-based ingredients as the recipe itself was declared illegal and destroyed in most known sources several centuries ago. The poison can be applied to any surface, adhering to it until it comes into contact with organic matter, which it quickly seeps into. It is clear, nearly invisible, and odorless, but can be easily identified by agitating the liquid in any way, which causes it to flash violently with varying hues of light. Due to its use in bringing down many nobles in past generations, it has been banned in nearly every established civilization. Being caught with it on your person is akin to an instant death sentence and one can only learn of its nature by asking the right person. Ask the wrong person, and you may find yourself put to death. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poisoned creature feels no immediate effect and is unaware of their condition. After a week, the creature gains an effect listed on the short-term madness table (DMG pg. 259). When the short-term effect ends, they gain an effect from the long-term madness table (DMG pg. 260). When the original long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term effect as well as an indefinite effect (DMG pg. 260). After each long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term and indefinite madness effect until they die or are cured. This effect can only be cured by a greater restoration spell cast at 7th level or higher.

___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A leafy evergreen tree, the trunks grow about as round as a man can reach, and their boughs are often fashioned into brooms by common people. The seeds hold another use, and are often ground into a fine powder called Green Sleeping Dust. The dust is primarily used by mercenaries in service to the royal family of Pentillia and as a sleeping drug in higher society. When this powder is inhaled, it forces a target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 2d6 minutes. If the drug is willingly consumed, the target does not have to make this throw and instead just falls unconscious.

### Blackcorn
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Resembling actual corn, but in far miniature, the plants generally grow on the edges of swamps and other humid areas. Unlike corn, it is overly difficult to cultivate and farm, which attributes to the rarity of the plant. Upon ripening, small ears of violet and coal colored corn stand upon the tips of the plant stalks. Eating the kernels provides a bitter taste to those willing to try it. However, the vegetable is prized not for eating, but for making a sweet alcohol called Blackcorn Whiskey that has a strong flavor of plums. Due to the heavy alcohol content, it is often mixed with fruit juices. A more potent version of the brew is often distilled by dwarves, but such a process takes considerably longer, and is worth up to 75 gold per bottle.

Those injured by a blade coated in the poison must succeed at a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 16 (4d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are Paralyzed for 1d6 minutes.

The target must make a DC 12 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the target will take 2d8 Necrotic damage, and be poisoned for 1d6 hours. During the duration of poisoning, the target will also have a temporary -2 penalty to Constitution. On a successful save, the target will only take half the necrotic damage and not be poisoned.

### Bloodbracken
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A predatory plant that spends 95% of its life underground. The seeds sprout and spread underground, sending out parasitic roots and drawing in nutrients. A few thin tendrils with unremarkable green leaves reach the surface. The seedpod, growing to the size of a large melon over the course of a two-year period, strains and creaks just below the surface. If a creature of sufficient weight steps on the soil above it, it will burst, releasing a cone of red branches that sprays upwards like a land mine, impaling and shredding the target for 10d8 slashing damage. One moment, nothing. The next, a 6' tall red twiggy bush growing through the body of your friend. As the body rots, it provides nutrients for the Bloodbracken to grow and produce seeds. It's entirely safe in this short-lasting mature stage, living to reproduce and wilting after only a few months. If a mature Bloodbracken is found in the wild, the base can be searched to yield bones of unlucky explorers and occasional whatever loot they had on them.

Floating on the surface of marshes, the plant consists of a cluster of broad, waxy leaves, and a single root that trails down into the water. The leaves are a bright green with red capillaries. During the warmer months a bright red flower sprouts from the top. Drying the plant causes it to turn into a flaky powder, which is often used in a distilled tincture to neutralize minor poisons. A single dose of Bloodpurge powder costs about 15 gold pieces, making the plant quite valuable.




\columnbreak

### Bloodroot
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A short plant that grows deep in the jungle, the stalks are covered with long pointed leaves. The plant also blossoms red flowers that appear to be similar to roses. Unearthing the plant reveals a massive crimson root that has a faint coppery scent. Many people seek out the plant for the root, which is said to ensure robust fortitude in those that consume it. Upon consuming the bloodroot, a living person must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1 minute. Immediately afterward the creature gains a +2 bonus to their Constitution saving throws for 1d4 hours. Although the initial rush of blood throughout the body causes people to become momentarily stunned, it is often still complimented for the other effects, which some say causes increased virility. What few know is that the root is also sought after by vampires, as it causes increased effects to their undead physiology. Many such creatures take steps to covertly acquire the plant. A vampire consuming the bloodroot immediately gains Advantage on Charisma based skill checks for the next 1d4 hours, and the herb causes them to immediately Rage (as per the Barbarian class feature) if they smell blood.



### Bloodspine
*[Desert](#p107), [Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A succulent plant growing in rocky soil, a cluster of thick leaves reach upward toward the sky, their edges covered in sharp thorns and the tips bearing a single crimson spine. Interestingly, the plant secretes a slight poison from these spines which may cause paralysis in small animals or the infirm. Those with hardier constitutions seek out the poison, as it provides a slight euphoric effect in addition to the paralysis. The poison requires only a DC 5 Constitution save, or the injured will suffer complete paralysis for 1d4 hours. Those that succeed at the saving throw notice a slight euphoric effect for the same amount of time.



### Bloodstaunch

___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A small, leafy herb that is often found in gullies and ravines in arid regions and foothills. The herb has bright green leaves, and smells faintly like honey crossed with fresh rainfall.

### Blueleaf
*[Arctic](#p107), [Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Known for the gleaming blue color of the leaves, the tree often grows in thick copses throughout the north. The thin trunks of the trees are remarkably durable, despite high winds and heavy snowfall, and one use of the tree is the wood, which is often used by the Volodni craftsmen to create weapons and armor. Magically treating the wood, which is called “bluewood”, causes it to become as hard as steel, although only weighing half as much (crafting with bluewood requires special training from a masterwork craftsperson). High priced entertainers often burn small pieces of the wood, which creates leaping blue flames. The leaves and sap are often ground in the creation of a vivid blue dye that is used to dye clothes in the North, and often in the creation of inks for tattoos. One pirate fleet that has plagued the Sword Coast in recent years is notorious for their crews bearing frightening looking blue tattoos covering their faces.



### Bocraugh

The monk sat under this tree and meditated for close to seven years, surviving only on the tree’s collected water droplets and on the tree’s bounty of figs. After learning of this monk’s quest for enlightenment, a corrupt king wanted in on this understanding of everything and wanted it only for himself, and ordered the tree destroyed. The roots were hacked at with swords and glaives and major limbs felled with large axes. 

All the while, the monk sat beneath the tree and still meditated. When the king’s servants had finished their destruction, the monk retrieved a bottle of sacramental wine from his bag and fed it to the tree’s damaged roots, vowing that if the tree should die, so would he. Upon the completion of this vow, the tree’s roots absorbed the wine and began to repair themselves at an incredibly rate, and the tree grew larger and lusher than it had been before. The location of the original tree has been lost to the ages, but cuttings of the tree have been transplanted to many of the major monasteries of the realm as a symbol of divine power and belief.



### Bone Fungus
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Bulbous ivory-colored fungus that releases a 10 ft cloud of spores, in the presence of motion, that work as an inhaled poison (DC Constitution 15, 1d8-1 poison damage). If damage is taken, bone density is reduced, resulting in extra damage from bludgeoning in the form of an extra space for criticals against you (19 or 20 counts as a crit). The fungi are immune to acid and thunder, destroyed by cold or radiant damage, fire and electricity also destroy but release spores. Recovery from the reduced bone density is only capable in the consumption of magically created potions and through Lesser Restoration spells.

___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Resembling Blackcorn in miniature, Brawler’s Blackcorn is a hardy plant that grows without light in dark cave environs. The kernels of this corn can be dried and ground and mixed into hard liquors, typically a bourbon (Brawler’s Bourbon). Brawler’s Bourbon is typically used by cheating gamblers to give themselves an unfair advantage. Ingesting the bourbon makes the user immune to its secondary properties, and so cheating brawlers may take a swig of the bourbon and spill some on their hands. The poison works as a contact toxin that will then weaken the opponent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The target must make a DC 14 Cons. Save vs poison or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature is then also knocked unconscious for the same amount of time. The target can be woken if they take damage or are shaken awake by another person. On a successful save, the target is then immune to the poison’s effects for 12 hours.

Cachuga peppers are vaguely pyramidal shaped woody bushes with profuse foliage that bear clusters of small, fragrant yellow blooms which eventually give way to fiery peppers of a marbled red-orange. The bushes bloom continually in the tropical climes of the Swordfish Islands causing Cachuga bushes to produce large numbers of these firey peppers. The peppers themselves are 2-4 inches long and hang from the bushes by thick, green, vein-like structures. Cachuga Peppers are exceptionally spicy and flavorful, and the skin of these peppers is leathery and can be mashed into a paste, then shaped and dried into chips or a flavorful yet non-spicy paper-like wrapping, pairing nicely with raw fish. The peppers dry well, retaining their fire and flavor for exceptional periods of time, and their seeds can be ground into a powder that causes *severe* eye and skin irritation (DC 16 Cons.

*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A pale, fleshy fungus with a tough, rubbery consistency that is commonly found growing near carnivorous plants. The fungus grows upon corpses, absorbing the cadaver's life memories and personality; up to 10 different minds have been found absorbed by one cephalophage mushroom. Eating cephalophage will transfer those memories and personality quirks to the eater. (Effects last 1d4 hours and while they last the eater can access all of the dead person's mind. After the effects wear off, the eater may still succumb on occasion to "flashbacks" or personality instability; when under intense stress or in a situation liable to cause such flashbacks, the user must make a roll of under their intelligence modifier or be overcome with memories of another person’s life.)

### Constrictor Vine
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Instead of growing upward to seek light, the Constrictor Vine spreads out across the ground as a thick mat of small, glossy leaves. The plant blooms occasionally with unremarkable clusters of small green flowers that give way to oblong yellow berries favored by birds and small animals. While the leaf mat of the Constrictor Vine rarely reaches more than 10' in diameter its root system can stretch as far as 50'. The fibrous roots of a Constrictor Vine resemble wet human hair, are incredibly strong, and retain much of this strength even after being harvested and dried. As the roots grow, they wrap themselves around rocks, root systems, and anything else in their path. When the roots reach ~30' to ~50' they begin to slowly, yet inexorably constrict back towards the core of the plant. This constriction has been known to topple whole trees and move many ton boulders. Since the process is so slow, it poses no real danger to living creatures.



### Cornus

### Corpsebomb
*[Swamp](#p111), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

The fungus begins life as a tiny spore that floats along until inhaled by a creature, and lodges itself in the moist tissue of the lungs. The spore then begins to grow, causing irritation, pain, and finally death once the fungus has reached a sizable mass. Once the host creature has perished, the fungus increases growth rapidly until it pushes a hollow tendril forth from the flesh. At the exposed end of the tendril the fungus begins growing a thin membrane, which is inflated by the gasses produced by the rotting body. When the membrane ruptures and disperses the spores, every breathing creature within a 40-foot radius sphere must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or inhale spores. If they fail, each hour afterward, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a -1 cumulative penalty to the roll. Each hour the creature suffers a cumulative 1d6 piercing damage (2d6 on the second failure, 3d6 on the third, etc.) as the fungus spreads throughout the internal organs. A single success stops the process and renders the fungus inert. If the fungus catches fire the spore sack soon explodes, and everyone within a 20-foot radius sphere suffers 3d6 fire damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw, DC 15, or half as much on a successful save. All spores are incinerated in this process.

Growing along the edge of the swamps, their gnarled roots reach down into the brackish water, and their spindly branches reach into the sky. The branches are covered with large amounts of small oval shaped leaves. During warmer seasons the trees bud small hard fruits that drop off to float along the slight currents of a swamp. This species of mangroves has flourished in areas where others have perished, simply for their ability to slowly pull up roots and move to areas with more moisture or better alkalinity. The species is also relatively destructive, as the mangroves also have been known to uproot small trees and brush, or simply walk over them, smashing them down. Wood from these trees burns easily, even when sopping wet.



### Crimson Ladies

In the summer, the vine sprouts red flowers that resemble a woman wearing a large dress. The flowers that blossom on the vine can be steeped in hot water to make a poisonous tea called Crimson Tears. When Crimson Tears is ingested, the drinker must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4+2 hours. During this time blood weeps from their eyes, and instead of seeing the world, they see horrific visions of things to come. After recovering from the visions, the character gains Advantage on a single skill roll utilized within the next day, as the visions gave them a brief glimpse of the outcome.

### Dainaberry
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

The Dainabush is a creeping, thorny vine, much like a bramble. Vines are about 5 mm thick, with 2 mm long thorns and are reddish brown, darkening to black, with leaves dark green in colour. The vines flower in early summer, with light blue, bell shaped flowers. In autumn, it carries dark blue or purple berries, which are fleshy, almost crunchy rather than juicy. The berries are slightly sweet and quite tasty, but have a strong effect on mammals: those who eat them fall asleep. The berries have this effect on mammals only (with half effects on half-mammals like half-elves and the like), but a single berry is enough to bring down any man sized or smaller mammal, and given enough berries, even the greatest mammal will fall asleep. There is no saving throw, although the sleep caused is quite normal, and a sleeping creature can simply be awakened. Although the berries can simply be eaten to cause the effect, it is also possible to dry them carefully and grind them into powder. This powder is weaker (DC 14 cons. save vs poison to avoid) but will keep for a much longer time. The powder can be added to any food or drink, but has a very sweet taste.



### Damiana
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A small shrub plant with small yellow flowers that grows predominantly in warmer climates. The flowers are commonly used in current times as a sexual stimulant, supposedly increasing arousal and sensation, but in the past, the flowers were brewed and fermented into a sickly-sweet beverage used in rituals designed to allow priests and participants to see “visitors” to the material plane. This recipe was lost to time, but if discovered, will grant the recipient truesight for 4 hours.



### Darkanda Bush
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

This small bush grows in desolate places, often in rocky soil high upon a cliff face. The branches are covered in small thorns and are gnarled and spindly, while the leaves are ragged and dark green. The bush produces small red flowers and bitter orange berries. 

When ground up and distilled, the leaves can be used to create an interesting alchemical acid called Dragon Sand that can be used as a poison or to corrode organic items. The substance appears to be a fine green powder, and has two peculiar properties. The first is that it acts like an acid to any organic substance. If it comes into contact with flesh or plant matter it slowly dissolves, dealing 3 (1d4+1) acid damage per round for 2 minutes per ounce contacting the organic substance, and leaving an acrid smell in the air. The second property is that it can be burned for an extended period. If set on fire it burns with leaping green flames, and when applied to wood, the log takes twice as long to burn as an equal amount of normal wood while producing much bigger, hotter flames.



### Darkberry

The mushrooms have a slight musky aroma resembling that of dead leaves. Several races seed Blackthorn mushrooms at the bottom of pits, turning them into a lethal surprise for anyone falling down upon them. Add 1d4 piercing damage to any falling damage incurred when a character falls down a hole that has Blackhorn growing at the bottom.



### Darkroot
*[River](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Touching the plant without gloves causes small cuts which grow swollen and irritated, and remain that way for several hours. The top of the plant sprouts a large bushy bud which is a light gold color. The bud emits a curious sugary fragrance which seems to irritate and deter undead and attract the living. Living characters must make DC 8 Wisdom throw to avoid suffering 1d4 piercing damage and some very itchy swelling. Undead that wish to approach closer than 30 feet from the bud must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw.



### Darnell
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

These tiny yellow flowers will, if eaten, cause dimness of the sight for 1d12 hours. This dimness means that in full light the character will see as if on a moonlit night. This herb does not affect those with truesight, but Darkvision range is reduced by half.



### Darsurion

### Death's Collard
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A leafy ground-cover plant that resembles simple collard greens but in shades of charcoal grey and blood red. Death’s Collard can be shredded and steeped in sacramental wine and garlic. Although the combination sounds frightening in itself, and actually acts as a minor poison to the living, the resulting mixture is savory in taste with an aftertaste of copper. The resulting mixture, called Bloodwine, is particularly harmful to vampires and other undead. Such creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws to resist the poison's effects. Bloodwine can also be consumed by a living creature, and it remains in the system of that creature for up to 12 hours. Any undead that attempt to consume the creature or drink its blood is affected by the Bloodwine as if they had ingested it themselves. An undead creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A small flowering shrub found in many plains environments across the realm, the flowers sprout through Spring, Summer, and Fall months, and resemble nuns’ hoods, even maintaining the black and white coloration. Some believe the shrubs were raised using magic in a conservative sect of Clerics or the ultra-religious as the flowering shrub grows up to a foot in every direction instantaneously whenever anyone within a 5’ reach of the shrub curses. This feature makes it a popular houseplant of those trying to refrain from profanity, as pruning the shrub proves to be a monotonous and time-consuming task.



### Deep Imaskari Waterplant

Fire Flower is a small bush which has one pale golden flower and small red berries with the appearance of a live coal. The flowers of the bush must be taken and crushed into a diamond or adamantine vial and left to cure for ten years. This is also the amount of time needed for a single flower to bloom. A single drop of this elixir will heal any illness or injury, but will not allow limbs or other appendages to grow back, and is said to return the dead to some state of undeath. This is an incredibly powerful herb, and is likely to only exist in the hands of powerful lords and kings.

### Firethorn
*[Coastal](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Often called the Sea Rose, this flower exists almost entirely on the Island of the Firethorns in the northern Sorlorn Sea. The flower grows in such numbers that it gives the lower areas of the island a reddish hue. At night the island faintly glows from a distance due to the natural glowing property of the flowers, and many that transverse the Great Sea know of the island’s distant glow. The island is generally uninhabited, with the exception of the fishing village of Safe Cove and the city of Hawa, because the Firethorns are so poisonous (DC 15 Cons. Save vs. poisoned while standing within 45 feet of the flowers and their pollen; on a failed save take 4d8 poison damage and be poisoned for 1d6 hours, on a successful save take half as much damage without being poisoned). Inhabitants of both settlements are well aware of the toxicity of the flowers, and often give them a wide berth.



### Firmanon
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A small, red-brown grass that grows in singular sprigs in open fields. Throwing this into a fire, causes a short but very strong ignition of the fire. The flames double in size for 3 minutes and you can hear the air rushing towards the fire working as fuel for the ignition.

___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Growing only in very wet soil, this small, ivy-like ground vine will produce white flowers in the springtime that produce a fine pollen that causes the inhabitants of nearby towns to cover their faces for a week after the Spring Equinox. When inhaled, the character will forget everything he has experienced during the last 24 hours. There is a 10% chance he will remember everything when confronted with facts about those 24 hours. After three days the amnesia becomes permanent and there is no hope of recovery, and this day will be forever lost in the person’s mind. Some sinister organizations have started propagating Fjor’da in order to harvest this pollen for use in an inhaled poison called Silt Fjor’da (DC 18 Cons. Save vs poison. On a failed save, the recipient automatically forgets the last 24 hours with no possibility of recovery. On a successful save, the recipient has a 50% chance to recover the memories of the day).



### Flame Clove
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

This large flower blooms in the height of summer, unfurling large red petals, and yellow-tipped orange tendrils which sway in the faintest of winds to give the illusion that the flower is on fire. As they often grow in large clumps, at first glance one might even believe that the ground was on fire. Such flowers are sought as decoration during the Summer Solstice and Midsummer celebrations in the Dalelands. Young women will wear them in their hair (+3 to Nature Checks while wearing the flower in this manner), and they are said to bring a bountiful crop to any person that would plant them near their front doors.

*[Plain](#p109), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A short plant with grey stalks and olive-colored hairy leaves, the Fleshwort thrives in areas where corpses lay. Often the plant will be seen on the site of battlefields, or where the dead were quickly buried. Some healers use the fibrous body of the Fleshwort to speed up the healing process (during a short rest, a character may add 1d6 to the total amount of hit points recovered).



### Flintmoss
*[Mountain](#p110), [River](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A dark grey moss, dotted with small flecks of rust-brown, Flint Moss is commonly found in area of thermal activity or bright and constant sunlight. The moss requires fire to spread its seeds, and will ignite from even the smallest sparks. A 3" cube of Flint Moss will burn for 3 to 4 hours and put off flame comparable to a normal sized camp fire. The moss growing on piles of rubble or loose rock is the most dangerous as friction from shifting stones can create enough heat or sparks to ignite patches of the moss, turning what was once a moss-covered mound of debris into a raging inferno. Application of Flintmoss to a bludgeoning weapon and lighting the weapon ablaze will add +3 fire damage to any successful attacks made with the weapon for 1d4+1 hours after application.



### Floure-du-luce
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Floure-du-luce has broad and flat leaves shaped rather like a sword. The flowers are purplish-blue and faintly glow, and the roots, which tend to stretch themselves along the surface of the ground, are reddish brown on the outside.

This 30-cm high plant has 3 thick, fleshy leaves, dark green and covered with soft hairs. The light green blades that account for its height are actually bunches sheathes from which flower stalks grow during the summer covered in a waxy, protective coating. From each of the sheathes (there can be as many as 30 to a plant), a single flower stalk grows with tiny purple flowers. The thick leaves, which can become as large as 20 cm across, can be torn loose and put inside your boots (one leaf to a boot), enabling you to walk all day without tiring or even getting footsore (negating the need for a Forced March), as well as adding 5 to your movement speed until the next long rest, at which point, the flower must be replaced.

The flowers can be dried and turned into powder which is then mixed with a strong alcohol made only from oranges. Drinking this potion causes massive hallucinations based on the character’s conscience. Good-aligned characters will see beautiful and wondrous things, while evil characters see the most foul and dark abominations. The hallucinations last 2d4 days. Good-aligned characters must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or become addicted after their first consumption while evil-aligned characters must make a DC 18 Wisdom save vs. fear or become slightly insane from these horrific visions (Long-Term Madness Table DMG pg.260).

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

The brown seeds of this herb (which has deep blue flowers), if chewed, remove all pain from a character’s wounds. It will also prevent a character from feeling any physical pain for 1d8 hours. The recipient could walk through a fire and feel no pain. There is a 50% chance per hour that a character moving normally will suffer 1d6 damage, while under the influence of this herb. This occurs because the character does not notice minor bruises or scratches. It was widely believed in medieval times that if the seeds of this plant were strewn across a vampire’s path the vampire would be unable to proceed further, until it had picked up and counted every seed. At the DM’s discretion this may be a use for this herb in campaigns.

___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

An invasive plague on many farmers is the weed that has been known to choke out large sections of crops if left unchecked. Many farmers curse the weed, as it has been one of the many factors that caused famine in recent years. Unfortunately, when burning Ginyak, the resulting smoke produces an acrid stench which lingers in the air for weeks afterward. Livestock dislike the smell and attempt to avoid it whenever possible (If burned, anyone in the presence of the smoke takes a -3 penalty to animal handling checks for 1 week).

Often found in clusters, these plants resemble brown leathery vases sitting on the ground with ragged leaves splayed out around the base where thick roots grasp the earth. The tops are open, and if one should peer inside the glint of their golden seeds can be seen in the interior. However, these plants are traps, and many explorer has come across the remains of smaller humanoids, their hands still clutching the golden seed pods. If someone is unwise enough to stick their hand within the pod, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or suffer 1d4 damage from the internal spines of the plant, and are then grappled. Their leathery surface has an Armor Class of 11, and to free a trapped arm 10 points of damage must be inflicted upon the plant.

### Goldenweb
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A quick growing fungus that is often found spread between tree branches, it appears as a strange lattice similar to spiderwebs. Light shining through the strands causes them to subtly glow the color of gold, and the fungus has also been called “Goblin’s Greed”. While the strands of the fungus are slightly stronger than spiderwebs, they lack the stickiness that would cause them to impede or entangle creatures. The fungus works surprisingly well as an anticoagulant, and is quite absorbent. Healers often seek the fungus out when attempting to remedy injury poisons, and use of the fungus grants a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) skill checks when used in such a manner.



### Gotu Kola

The mold moves slowly enough that even people sleeping in its path have no fear of being overwhelmed, although corpses that lay in the same place for days will be overcome. The Grammax also floats on water, often spreading across the surface of underground puddles and stagnant lakes, hiding the actual depths. The Grammax reacts rapidly to the presence of flame or high heat, quickly shrinking away while expelling any trapped gas. This action of the escaping gas makes an odd shrieking sound that is akin to the sound a screaming child makes. While it is a barely palatable prospect, the mold can actually be consumed as a source of food for those lost and desperate enough (at the cost of a level of exhaustion when consumed by any race except for goblinoids). Oddly, goblins seem to enjoy the taste of the mold, and often scrape it up as a renewable food source.

### Gravefist
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A pale white mushroom with five knobby protrusions, the mushroom often resembles a skeletal hand reaching upward. When the mushroom grows in clusters, it appears as if numerous corpses are attempting to reach out of the soil. The fungus predominantly grows in the Underdark; however, it has also been seen in dark basements and unused root cellars. Several tales of superstition follow the fungus, many believing that if it appears in rooms below your house, someone will soon die in the residence. This may be partially due to the fact that the mushrooms release toxic spores that slowly inflict 4d8 poison damage over 2d8 days to people that sleep or live within 100 feet of this fungus for that period of time.



### Green-Air Bramble
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Fast-growing creeping vine that sprouts green berries and a small number of thorns. Can grow in most inhospitable climates and only needs to be in moist soil for 6 hours per week.

*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

These dark violet flowers are often found at the edges of graveyards and sites of massive battles. Those that tend gravesites often call them “Death Trumpets” for their shape, and they emit a smell similar to that of a corpse. Thus, when such flowers are noticed, they are often pulled up by the root, to remove such an unpleasant odor. However, despite their terrible odor, it is believed by followers of Kelemvor and Bane that should you die with the seeds of this plant in your possession, your spirit will find an easier path to the afterlife. Thus, many keep the seeds of such a flower in a cloth bag close to their chest. Unfortunately for others, this means that the flowers often sprout from the corpse several days after the death of such individuals.

___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Growing in the swamps, the plant appears to be little more than a pair of large, broad leaves floating on the surface of the stagnant water. During warmer months, a large yellow flower blossoms in the midst of the two leaves. Hidden beneath the surface, the plant has an extensive root system that reaches far down into the muck in a massive tangle that catches debris carried along by the slow current. Various species of fish and snakes lay their eggs in the tangle of roots. Various orc tribes harvest the Guklulla for the roots, pulling the plants out of the muck, cutting off sections of the roots and throwing them back into the swamp to be harvested again in the future. Grinding the root into a paste and applying it to wounds provides not only accelerated healing (+4 when using hit dice during a short rest. If the recipient of the healing is an orc or half-orc, they receive an additional 1d4 hit points.), but also numbs the affected area.



### Gulthias Tree
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*

___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Growing in clumps, these tall purple flowers are often planted in tranquil gardens and are commonly seen on gently rolling fields. The stalks bear symmetrical pairs of long tapered leaves with purple veins. Farmers dislike the plants because they tend to choke out food crops, such as corn. The flowers emit a subtle and sweet fragrance which not only smells nice, but also is a repellant to certain predatory insects, such as mosquitoes and dragonflies. Those that can afford to pay for it often rub Haella Fragrance on their unprotected skin during warmer months to repel such vermin (-5 to rolls for initiative for Insectoids).



### Halcyon Crocus
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

In the highland meadows of the Dalelands grows a pale white-silver crocus. By starlight, nectar can be harvested from its simple bloom and dried into snuff that engulfs the user in bittersweet recollections of yore. With each dose of the Halcyon Snuff the user remembers a spell forgotten, effectively allowing him or her to cast it again without expending a spell slot.

Stems of bright green hold jagged leaves that grow in clusters of three. The plant grows delicate yellow flowers that smell pleasant, with the smell often drifting in the breeze on warm summer nights. The golden flowers that blossom from the plant grow to resemble a pair of hands pressed together. A common belief is that the flower resembled the hands of Laretha, a young cleric of Tymora, while she prayed to the gods to save her from misfortune at the hands of a horde of bandits. Her prayers were answered by the arrival of a group of adventurers. Afterward the flowers appeared near her shrine, a sign that the goddess was looking over her. Commonly used by paladins and clerics, the flowers grant a +3 to any religion checks when worn as a crown or behind the ear.



### Hangman Tree
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A deciduous tree named for the noose-like ropy appendages that hang down from the branches, the trees are known to entrap the unwary. Their shallow roots and sparse leaves require the tree to seek nutrition through being carnivorous. 

The main body of the trunk has a hollow tube containing a digestive acid. The ropy appendages drag trapped prey upward and drops them inside the opening. The opening is surrounded by a number of downward facing spines which make escape difficult. Due to the shallow roots, the trees may move at a glacial pace, allowing most prey to easily outrun them. However, the trees rely upon a perfume their leaves emit that causes hallucinations to lure potential victims closer. Upon an encounter, PC’s must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save or be lured in to the tree’s appendages. The character must then make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity save to avoid taking 8d6 acid damage. Tree can be attacked as well:

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A multi-colored flower ranging between yellow and purple and everywhere in between with several strands of fiber attached to the petals across the empty space in the center of the flower. A few decades ago, an herbalist found that strumming the fibers would hold a tune, and since then, the flowers have become a common gift for friends and loved ones. Some talented herbalists have learned to breed the Harlequin’s Harps in a way that the fibers can be tuned to specific notes for personalized gifts.



### Harpy Nest

___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

The mottled trunk of these trees is often seen growing in rocky soil. The upper limbs of the tree curve inward upon the trunk, and become a large tangled mass.

For the most part, the villagers did not part with their recipe and the secret of heather mead is now lost to the ages. Whether or not any survivors went on to make more is still a mystery, but every now and then, a bottle of heather mead will pop up in a small, far-off market, fetching an exorbitant price.

### Helmthorne
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A vine-like shrub, often growing in remote and desolate locations, the shrub has dark green leaves, and sprouts indigo colored berries. The shrub is named due to long black thorns that protect the plant from various foraging animals. The berries are often harvested to be eaten, or can be fermented to make Helmthorn Wine.

Bloom colors are typically red with yellow ribs, or pink with dark red ribs, but some sages claim there are thousands of different color combinations and variations. If a Hidden Hibiscus is threatened, or detects rapid movement nearby, any blooms on the bush immediately change their color to drab greens and browns, and the entire plant appears to wilt and wither. Skilled alchemists use the roots of the Hidden Hibiscus to amplify their creations that aid in natural camouflage (adding wilted hidden hibiscus to armor will negate any stealth penalties that the armor normally has), but the blooms of the hibiscus are its true prize as they can be used to dramatically increase both physical and mental speed for short periods of time (+2 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence stats for 1d4+1 hours). Only brightly colored blooms can be used in these speed-increasing concoctions, and once a Hidden Hibiscus changes the color of one of its blooms, they never change back.

It was known that Jelly Moss, when crushed, becomes very messy and sticky, but until an unlucky professor sat a small sample of Jelly Moss that’d been left on his chair, no one had realized this goo would create an almost instant, permanent, bond of incredible strength with wood.

A normal sized tree will have between 100 and 200 ripe berries. 15 of these berries should be crushed and mixed with boiling water. When the liquid has cooled, the infusion should then be drunk in order to relieve status effects temporarily (3d4 hours). This liquid will only keep for a month under normal conditions, but can be mixed with an alcoholic spirit to increase its lifespan indefinitely.

### Korogg
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Korogg is a rare underdark fungus that typically grows on the corpses of dead miners and dwarves who aren’t properly buried. Black, bulbous bodies with fine black mycelia produce a fungal fruit called Korogg Pods, which can then be reduced to their juice and distilled. This rich liquor is sought after for its taste and smell. When a character imbibes Korogg Liquor, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save. The liquor quells freethinking: no person who drinks it need make an Investigation check while under its influence for the duration of a day, as the result will incur a -8 penalty since they can’t think of anything their investigation might mean, and the consumer takes a -1d6 penalty to wisdom checks after consumption until the next long rest.

### Krakaem Pods
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Growing off of tree branches, at first inspection this fungus appears to be the cocoon of an insect. The fungus is intrusive, sending tendrils into the tree branches and stealing water reserves. Sporadically another pod will emerge from the tree branch, swell to the size of a human fist, and then burst, sending a cloud of black spores floating on the wind. The spores are a severe irritant and may even cause temporary blindness if a large mass of spores get into the eyes of a creature (DC 12 Constitution Save if within 15 feet of the tree). The pods are also sought after for food, as frying them in oil and serving them with fish is a delicacy served in Waterdeep.



### Kylathar
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

Anyone who eats the yellow, soft, plum sized fruits instantly has two random stats exchanged; Strength with Constitution, Wisdom with Dexterity; anything is possible (the DM should determine which statistics are exchanged). There is no saving throw, and no cure (DM’s discretion). Eating more of the berries will simply cause more stats to be randomly exchanged. Short of magical storage, the fruits will spoil and rot within 2 days after plucking. The bush itself grows about 2 meters high, with long, dusty green leaves, which are slightly sawed. The flowers grow in groups of 4 to 8, and are yellowish white with orange edges. The flowers grow in late spring, the fruits are ripe in autumn.



### Laishaberries
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Laishaberries grow on dark green, knee-high bushes. The leaves of the bushes are hard and waxy, and stay on long into autumn, sometimes even into winter. Concealed under the leaves, the red, cherry sized berries grow in spring and early summer, developing from small, fragrant, wax blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The berries taste quite bland themselves, although they can be used to add a special taste to all kinds of jellies. When ripe, the berries can be eaten raw, and will each heal 2 hp of damage, or speed the recovery from most diseases. However, they will also render the eater mute for 20 minutes for each berry eaten. Also, if more than 5 or 6 berries are eaten at a time, a DC 12 Cons. saving throw vs poison is required to avoid severe and somewhat debilitating stomach cramps that will incur a -2 penalty to Dexterity saves and checks for 1d3 hours. A jelly made from the berries themselves loses both the healing and silencing powers (and the danger of cramps) of the fresh berries, but the curative effects for most diseases is doubled; fresh berries reduce the recovery time by one day for each berry eaten, the jelly halves the total time.

The yellow powder is not addictive, but it can lead to a detrimental state of internalization and paranoia. Any session where a character uses the yellow powder, he must make a Wisdom check on 1d20.

The leaves are often boiled down to an essential oil, and the resultant infusion added to starchy natural substances to produce a gum. A piece of this gum will allow the recipient to survive without oxygen for 2d4 x 10 minutes, provided they are conscious and able to chew. The herbs main use is in allowing the recipient to survive in oxygen poor or free environments such as underground. When a tree is found it will normally have 5d10 leaves. Taking too many leaves can harm the tree. The tree has a chance of dying equal to the percentage of the leaves taken. For example, if 30% of the leaves are taken the tree has a 30% chance of dying, if 50% are taken it has a 50% chance of dying. The leaves are also said to have a calming effect when chewed (DM’s discretion).

Tenacious, large green-stemmed weed that can spring up over-night in temperate grasslands, plains and farmlands. It easily threatens crops, and its powdered stem can be made into an anti-coagulant called White Sanguine, which when added to an injury poison, causes the victim to bleed for 1 point of damage each round for one minute if it fails a DC 15 Constitution save against the poison. Magical healing or a DC 15 Medicine check stops the bleeding.

### Midnight Coneflower
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

An incredibly rare flower found on mountainous peaks that only blooms on a blue moon, sprouting from the ground into a shiny, white plate-sized flower, and retracting back into the ground before dawn. The petals of this flower can be ground into a fine white powder used in the creation of two separate, but equally deadly poisons.

If the powder of the Midnight Cone petals is combined with the Midnight Cone’s Nectar, the two can be mixed to create a sweet smelling, sweet tasting syrup that becomes inert when ingested. However, this process creates a powerful, delayed-response contact poison called Goodbye Kiss. Typical application sees the flower’s pure nectar applied to the assassin’s lips as a protective barrier followed by an application of the Goodbye Kiss syrup, and then the assassin giving the target a kiss. A creature subjected to this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw vs. poison, taking 13d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, the Midnight Cone Flower’s petals can be made into Midnight Tears, an equally potent ingested poison. Many nobles have died peacefully in their sleep while their loved ones lay nearby, falling to the effects of a dose of Midnight Tears administered by a stealthy assassin many hours before. The only side-effect of the poison, that can very easily be missed in investigation, is the presence of the white, pearlescent tears that the poison is named for, seeping from the recipient’s eyes as if they were crying in their sleep. Again, a creature subjected to this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw vs. poison, taking 13d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Mistletoe is a parasitic evergreen shrub that grows mostly in copses of other evergreens. Mistletoe has long been a sacred herb to druids, and branches of mistletoe have been hung from the ceilings to ward off evil spirits for centuries. The origin of kissing under the mistletoe comes from an age-old story of the deities, that Eldath, the goddess of peace was nearly slain with an arrow made of a mistletoe branch. When she was revived from the brink of death, the mistletoe was then turned over to the domain of Sune, the goddess of love and she vowed that whenever anyone passed under a branch of mistletoe they would kiss to illustrate that mistletoe had become a symbol of love and not of hate.

During warmer months the bush sprouts flowers of yellow and orange, which turn into sweet little berries. The leaves and berries of the bush can be harvested and rendered down to create a waxy resin that is often used to seal the hulls of seagoing boats, replacing pitch. The practice is far from common, as the process to create the resin is far more expensive than using the traditional methods. Some seamstresses also coat their threads in the resin, which allows for the creation of finer garments. These garments represent armored fine clothing, the appearance of fine clothes with the protection of light armor (AC 11+Dexterity Mod).

A tall, woody-stemmed plant that when broken releases copious amounts of a thin, milky fluid. When the sap of Mother’s Mercy is refined to a slightly thicker milky fluid, it becomes a peaceful but powerful poison. After ingestion, a creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned on a failed save, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. While poisoned in this way, the creature's Constitution score decreases by 2. On each successive failed save, the creature's Constitution score is further reduced by 1. If a creature's Constitution score if reduced to 0 in this way, it dies. After two consecutive successful saves, the poisoning ends and the creature's Constitution score is restored.

The strength of the wood lends itself to be an excellent choice for tool handles, bows, and small boats. The multicolored grains are regularly in fashion for jewelry making in such places as Waterdeep and Suzail. However, because of excessive logging over several centuries, the tree can only be found in isolated copses, often far from centers of civilization.

### Pixie Table
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Rare 1-foot tall and 1-foot diameter mushroom with a dark lavender cap that can be found in any woodland but is most common in temperate forests housing Fey.

It is the main ingredient for a red liquid called Memorybind, which allows a prepared caster to prepare an extra 1st level spell in exchange for reducing all save DCs by 2 until the next long rest.



### Poison Apple

Meat, root and seeds are edible and high in protein, core of the plant is filled with juice, the fibers are similar to cotton, and the rind can be used as a sharpening strap for fine blades. A new fruit starts growing as soon as the old one is plucked, taking 2 weeks to grow to maturity.



### Pondstone Tree
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A towering willow relative that grows in tropical and near-tropical swamps, pondstone wood is often used for its flexibility while freshly cut to construct simple boats and canoes. In addition, the reduction of the wood over a low flame will cause a collection of sap on the ends of the wood. This sap can then be collected, further distilled, and consumed as a tincture that induces mild hallucinogenic effects, including the capability to see one’s own body from a third person point of view. It is argued among enthusiasts about whether you truly do see yourself in third person or whether the hallucinations are just a reconstruction of your surroundings using artificially heightened senses. There are no known negative side effects to pondstone sap consumption, and the recreational use of pondstone sap is referred to as Sap Goggling.

___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Poznan's Chain is a soft-wooded clinging vine armed with white, pearlescent spines, 2" to 3" in length that alternate the entire length of the vine with leathery leaves. These vines are typically only found growing on sheer cliff faces or the most opulent ruined buildings. While a single chain will usually run for 20' to 50' and spread to cover an area of about 200 square feet, some vines are purported to reach 100' or more and cover thousands of square feet with their leaves and thorns. The thorns of Poznan's Chain secrete a virulent poison that causes internal organs to violently rupture and hemorrhage (DC 18 Cons. Save. On a failed save take 6d8 poison damage and the poisoned effect for 6 hours, and on a successful save take half as much damage with no secondary effect.), leading to a bloody death in as little as 20 to 30 seconds. Curiously, if this poison is collected and taken more than 5' from the vine it immediately becomes water. Some claim that Poznan's Chain can produce large, silvery, metallic, star-shaped blooms, but these reports have never been verified.



### Prickly Tea
*[Jungle](#p108)*

### Psyllium
*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A very common weed in both cities and plains alike, Psyllium is a broad-leafed ground plant with a central stalk that buds small green seeds. Psyllium is a useful plant that is commonly used to treat constipation, scurvy, and to aid in weight-loss. Aside from its common uses, Plantain Weed is one of the weeds and herbs mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.



### Purple Pipeweed
*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A short, purple weed that was originally a farm-field pest before it started being farmed itself can be dried and smoked, and is in fact very commonly smoked by spellcasters that focus on illusory magic. For one hours after smoking a quantity of pipeweed, the consumer is elevated to a higher state of imagination. This unfortunately gives them an increased chance of being surprised (enemies in combat will always will a surprise round against the pipeweed smoker while he or she is under its effects) but also increases the spell save DC of any illusion magic cast by the pipeweed user by +2.



### Pygmy King Flower
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

The Pygmy King Flower produces a conical, flower-like structure from a base of 8-10 fat, fluid filled leaves that resemble a broken rib cage. The flower is usually 1' in diameter, 2' tall, and always brightly colored. While the color can vary greatly, solid orange and blue with yellow spots are the most common colors in tropical locales. Nectar fills at least half of each basin shaped flower and when exposed to sunlight this liquid releases a sweet, sugary fragrance. Small creatures and large insects are attracted to this smell but upon entering the flower they are trapped by its slippery walls and slowly digested. When a Pygmy King Flower finishes digesting a meal, or becomes over filled (such as after a heavy rain) the flower will tilt and dump its contents onto the jungle floor before slowly righting itself once more. The succulent, rib shaped leaves at the base of this plant can be mashed into a salve that is an excellent treatment for major burns and minor lacerations (successful application of this salve can cure up to 2d8 fire damage if applied within 3 rounds of taking that damage).

A low, waxy-leafed shrub plant with large yellow flowers pointed upward. These flowers collect water and the flowers’ natural nectar and pollen then sweeten the water and add some essence that makes the liquid inside slightly intoxicating. A common tradition in some parts of the realm is to have a picnic the day after a rainstorm next to a Queen’s Ambrosia bush so that the flowers may serve as refreshment for the old and for the young to sneak sips from.



### Quicksilver Lichen

### Quickweed
*[Coastal](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Quickweed grows as a series of short, flat, silvery leaf blades along a single root runner, and is so named because it completes its entire life cycle in a single week. A living/growing end and a decaying/dying end is clearly visible on each root runner, and with patient observation it is possible to watch the root grow and die in real time. The grass always grows in a single direction along its root causing entire fields of Quickweed to appear to migrate around islands, like a wave, as time goes by. Alchemists prize Quickweed as it acts as an additive that amplifies the benefits of concoctions related to time, speed, and travel.



### Quivar

___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A low-lying, ground-cover leafy plant that grows through a layer of snow, never seeing sunlight, but absorbing and using the cold as food. Nomadic tribes of the far north have been known to seek out the plant, dry it, and smoke the leaves to gain an additional +50% movement speed for 8 hours.

The flowers of the Rainbowpetal can appear as any color and individual petals will even grow in distinct colors on the same flower. The petals of these flowers are thick, fleshy, and surprisingly nutritious. They are frequently boiled into a thick and flavorful porridge or dried and used in place of bread crumbs or cornmeal on fried food. If eaten raw, a single spike of Rainbowpetal flowers can sustain a normal sized human for a full day.



### Rampalt

### Ratavasa Flowers
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A short purple flower that grows close to the ground, the plant is generally little more than a few floppy leaves sitting above the soil. However, during the warmer months, the plant sprouts a cluster of small purple flowers that smell faintly of cinnamon. The petals of the flower are often steeped in hot water to create a tea that prevents conception. Any female drinking the tea is unable to become pregnant within the next two days.



### Rattlestalks
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

These tall stalks that grow out of stagnant water end in a thick bulb with a hard shell. In the warmer months, the stalk withers, and the bulb falls off, to float around until the bulb softens and falls away to disperse the seeds within. The seeds sit freely in the shell, and when shaken make a slight rattling noise, which is unnerving when the wind rushes through a cluster of rattlestalks. Tribes that live in the swamps will often use the unnerving aspect of the rattlestalks to create fear inducing noisemakers that are then added to spears and other weapons. When rattled, those that have no knowledge of the rattlestalks must make a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw, or be Frightened for 1d4 minutes.



### Razorvine

Redgold's Feather grows as small, tight cluster of burnished, copper-colored, feather-shaped fronds near areas of thermal activity. The plant is impervious to heat, and some claim to have even seen it undergo instantaneous growth when exposed to direct flame. If the leaves of this plant are broken or crushed they give off an acerbic odor potent enough to wake a person from unconsciousness (even magical) or immediately recover from being dazed or disoriented. If the feathers are crushed and combined with sulfur and the essence of a naturally fiery creature, an alchemist can create a non-toxic liquid that will glow a bright orange for 36-48 hours (even after being consumed and digested).



### Redroot
*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Redroot is a tangled mass of leafy shoots that grows close to the ground. While it does grow wild in a large swath of the Realms, it is also sometimes intentionally planted on farms. Pulling a ripened root from the ground reveals a large crimson colored tuber. The tuber is often turned into a curative paste which can be applied to wounds to soothe the pain and speed healing (+5 to any hit dice expended during a short rest). While helpful for healing, ingesting the root often causes nausea and vomiting (DC 16 Constitution Save to avoid vomiting and nausea for the next 1d4 hours).



### Redstar Flowers
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A strange plant with a translucent pink stem, numerous small branches fork off of the main stem, each of them ending in a small red flower with five petals. Each flower has a small opening which leads down the branch to a small pool of sap. The sap has a sickeningly sweet aroma which draws in small insects, which then become disoriented and perish in the sap and are dissolved. The plant is often harvested for the sweet sap, which is sifted to remove the remains of insects. Next the sap is heated, and used to coat confections and pastries, which then hardens to become a glaze. Bakers in small cities will pay a large price for the raw sap.



### Rewk

___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

This unusual rose, often identified by the multicolored petals, are only found rarely in the wild, as their scent causes lingering problems. Their tangled vines are covered in sharp red thorns, and the smooth green leaves are tinged in orange. Those that smell the mesmerizing fragrance of the roses must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or forget the past 2d4 minutes. Failing the saving throw by 5 or more causes the victim to forget the past 1d6 hours, and a spellcaster to forget 1d6 spells occupying the highest spell slots first. Those that fail the saving throw by 10 or more forget the past 1d6 days, and spellcasters forget 2d6 spells occupying the highest spell slots first. Rolling a 1 on the saving throw causes the inhaler to suffer from complete amnesia, and can only be cured by a Wish, Greater Restoration, or 8th level Heal spell to restore their forgotten identity.



### Rosecork
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A short tree that sprouts many thick, diverging branches and a plentiful amount of small ovular leaves. The bark is a light shade of red, and darkens during winter months. Due to the considerable amount of moisture that the trees retain, it is seen as a poor choice for burning. Rosecork wood will often take several hours of exposure to flame for enough water to evaporate to the point where the wood burns. It is for this reason that it is occasionally used in construction in areas surrounding volcanoes or in the construction of war-boats and battleships. 



### Rouddan
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A root vegetable, the leaves of the Rouddan are broad and soft. Known as the “red turnip of Fallingard” it is a staple food of nearby peasants. Due to necessity, a large variety of different methods of preparation have arisen, including a thick stew of Rouddan, and as a base for slop mashes. The root keeps well when kept in a cool and dry climate, and resists decomposition well. While they can be eaten raw, they are best soaked in broth or spiced water (heals for 1d4 hit points if eaten raw or 1d8 hit points if eaten in soup; the creation of soup can also split a single Rouddan into 8 servings).

### Ruby Blushrose
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___

The long stems of the rose are oddly free of thorns that grace other similar flowers, while the rose itself is abundant among the plant’s setms, large, and red. The rose tends to grow in clumps with others of the same species. Smelling the rose has a curious effect, as the pleasing aroma causes people to blush. Extended exposure to the aroma causes exhaustion and light-headedness. Those that spend more than a few moments within 10 feet of a blushrose must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer Disadvantage on Constitution and Wisdom saving throws for as long as they remain within proximity and 2d6 minutes afterward. Some romantics declare that the blushrose brings the euphoric and lightheaded feelings of being in love to the forefront.

___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

This shrub plant is found growing in the sands of coastal dunes and has leaves which are bluish in tinge. The root is dark blue in color and small, pill-like growths sprout from these roots. Consuming one of these growths will allow the recipient to breathe underwater for 10 minutes, by allowing them to absorb the oxygen in the water directly into their skin through osmosis. Their skin has a translucent appearance for these ten minutes. This process also works above water, but not as effectively, making it uncomfortable to do much of anything for the time spent above the surface.



### Sable Fir
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A hardy tree that spreads runners from one original “mother” tree, sometimes creating entire forests from one tree.

Long regarded as a plant sacred to Druids and Rangers of Sadaq, Sadaq’s Bedwort is a low-growing ground cover plant found in beds near flooded plain areas and rivers. Preparation of the bedwort in sacramental wine under the light of the new moon will allow for the creation of a concoction called Sadaq’s Empathy. This concoction will allow the recipient to converse with plants and animals in the native tongue for a period of up to 12 hours after consumption. In addition, the recipient will also have lowered spell component costs for spells involving nature and plant growth, or that target plants and animals. Harvesting too much of a bed at the same time will cause the bed to begin to rot as the bed is actually a single organism that spreads deep into the earth.



### Saddilia
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

This rare tree can grow up to 60 feet tall and can survive to quite old ages. It has dark red wood, and equally dark blue leaves. The flowers, which grow in small bunches, are startling white, almost radiant. Its nuts have a very special property; each nut raises the Intelligence or Wisdom (determine randomly) of the eater by 0.1 point (20 nuts or 2 full points max). 

The effect lasts for a whole week, after which it fades again, although there is a 1% chance the effect is permanent. Around the tree there are often animals (squirrels, salmon) who eat the nuts on a regular basis, and are therefore quite intelligent, often possessing speech or even (DM’s discretion) spellcasting abilities. The number of nuts available varies greatly, depending on the age of the tree, the number of creatures aware of its existence, but mainly, of course, on the DM’s wishes. 



### Saffron
*[Plain](#p109)*
___

Lasts for 1 hour or until hit points are drained, has the side-effect that within 24 hours of use, a creature cannot stabilize on its own (so even with successful death saves, the creature or person must be assisted). Regular use gives a signature salt and slight rotten fish smell.

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

This dwarf tree is favored among nobility of the southern provinces, as it is easy to cultivate and grows quickly. The sparse leaves it produces are diamond shaped and light green with a tinge of pink on the edges. The exercise in restraint is one lesson that the Sasami Tree teaches children of the wealthy patience and restraint. Cutting off too many branches causes the tree to sicken and perish, while allowing the tree to grow wild often causes the tree to turn into an unruly mess. The leaves are often exchanged as a decorative gift between servants and their far-off relatives.

- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

This herb will place the recipient into a deep sleep for 24 full hours. The recipient cannot be woken even by magical means. At the end of the day, all wounds will be healed and hit points regained. It does not, of course, resurrect a dead person, but the plant’s magically induced coma will in fact regenerate lost limbs.

### Seregon
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Coin-sized blood-red flowers that bloom directly from their roots in rocky soil. Ingesting the flower’s nectar grants the creature 2d6 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour or until expended. This effect cannot be combined with any other effect that grants temporary hit points.



### Serpent Sweat
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

The fungus appears to be a cluster of small yellow beads, often growing on decomposing matter. Small black stems hold them aloft, and their surface is shiny enough to reflect torchlight. While the fungus may appear like berries, they are quite poisonous. Underdark denizens will often collect the fungus wearing leather gloves to prevent touching it with their skin. When the fungi are touched with bare hands must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1d4 hours and begin to sweat profusely. Those that fail the saving throw by 5 or more suffer 24 (8d6) poison damage.



### Serren Wood
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

Tall, hardy trees transplanted from Arborea's top layer of Arvandor, and a vessel for nature spirits. Bows, Arrows, or Crossbow bolts made from this wood add 1d4+1 radiant damage to any successful attack. Exceptionally difficult to craft with.



### Sessali
*[Coastal](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A rugged, thorny plant found by the sea. The leaves must be boiled for two hours in salt water, and the resultant mix sweetened with honey. This mixture will act as a cure for certain types of long-term, typically incurable ingested poisons or wasting diseases (DM’s discretion, as to which ones). The recipient must be made to drink one dose immediately when the mixture is ready, and then further doses every twelve hours for three days (7 doses in all). If the number of successful applications is four or more, the patient will recover.



### Sezarad
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Broad vivid flower with a short brittle root which, when chewed, functions as a stimulatory drug. The initial effect is 1d8 temporary hit points and an additional 1d8 hit points after two full minutes of chewing that stack with each other and last for 10 minutes after initial ingestion or until used up. -1 to Wisdom checks for 20 minutes after ingestion.



### Shadbush
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A red, waxy-leafed bush that produces small, burgundy colored berries that can be eaten in small amounts to ward off scurvy and nutrition-related illness.



### Shadowrose
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A perfectly black rose bush, with black roots, stems, leaves, and buds, that grows only in deep caves and wilts in the presence of any light, magic or non-magic, brighter than a candle. When the petals of this rose are consumed, it will grant a regeneration rate of 3 hit points per round for 2d10 rounds. After that, the recipient will be unable to perform any action, including movement, for 2 rounds.



### Shadowtop
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A rather tall and fast-growing tree that can be found throughout Faerun. The leaves only grow at the very top of the tree and appear dark green from above and have a copper hue from beneath. These leaves are also highly flammable, and are often gathered to be used as tinder. The wood of the tree is quite fibrous, but not dense enough to be worthwhile building material. Instead the strands are often broken down and woven into thick rope. The wood burns fairly hot and long and without an abundance of smoke, thus making it ideal for use in hearth fires and torches.



### Shaggy Ink Mushrooms
*[Swamp](#p111), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A small, button mushroom that can be milked to harvest a shiny black liquid. This liquid, if consumed or absorbed through the skin, will cause the recipient to mope about vocally, and loudly question their choices in life. Affected creatures just want to lean against the wall and cry. A save is allowed for every instance they are slapped by another person, DC 16 Wisdom Save, with a cumulative -1 to the DC per slap. 



\pagebreakNum



### Shepherd's Purse
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

This herb rarely grows to a height of more than 18 inches. It has small greyish green leaves, growing smaller towards the summit of the plant. It has small four petalled cream-white flowers at its peak. If applied as a compress within 4 turns of taking poison damage, it will undo up to 3d4 of that damage.



### Silver Hibiscus
*[Jungle](#p108), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

This silver-grey plant looks as though it represents madness itself. It often has random patterns and unplanned shapes, but always has a black web-like pattern on it. If touched bare-handed, the target must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save or take 2d6 Psychic damage. When prepared correctly, the leaf can take on the special qualities of the elements and grant a talentaed herbalist 3 uses of an elemental breath weapon, randomly chosen from Lightning, Poison, Fire, or Acid.



### Silver Tassel Toadstool
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

Growing deep within damp caves, Silver Tassel Toadstool is a slightly fluorescent shelf toadstool that has small structures resembling tassels hanging from its edge. These tassels are actually the fungi’s reproductive organs, and the spores from these structures can be harvested and mixed with oil to create an ingested poison called Pale Tincture. This milky liquid is the primary choice of cruel manipulators that often use it to coerce favors out of unwilling acquaintances. 

The poison is introduced unknowingly, and slowly chips away at the victim's vitality, always threatening a slow and painful death. The promise of a cure is enough to make most people do things that they would otherwise avoid. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw vs poison or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 8 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally, and only a greater restoration spell can end this poison outside of the cure or making the successful saving throws. The cure can be made by harvesting the toadstool’s spores and combining these with alcohol that is then exposed to at least 15 points of radiant damage, which is enough to mutate the poisonous compounds in the spores.

### Silverleaf
*[Mountain](#p110), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Only blooming by the light of a full moon, the plant appears to be largely nondescript until seen at night in full bloom. The entire plant is basked in a silvery glow, and the flower is large and luminescent white. At the end of the night the flower falls off of the plant and quickly wilts in the morning sun. However, before the flower wilts, it can be ground into a fine powder, the mere smell of which repels lycanthropes, who take a -8 penalty to initiative when in the presence of the fresh flower.



### Silverthorn
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

Silverthorn is a small thorny plant, white in color with red berries and silver thorns. This herb can function either as a poison or as an antidote to itself. It is found only by one specific lake located high in the mountains. For use as a poison the thorns must be crushed and boiled in oil over the course of a night, at which point, the resultant mixture may be smeared on the end of a weapon. When the weapon pierces its target, the poison will take effect killing the victim within 2d6 hours. There is no save and no cure, except for the antidote outlined below. Not even the most powerful magic can cure this poison. The only cure for this poison is also made from the Silverthorn plant. The berries must be boiled in absolutely pure water, prepared in a pure silver vessel, and the resultant mixture stored in an adamantine vial until use. The liquid must be placed on the dying victims lips, where within 1d20 minutes, they will recover from the poisoning.



### Silverwood
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A type of tree nurtured by sylvan elves to grow into unique forms, be free of disease and produce delicious sap that is made into the famous Elven Silvermead. The sap is clear and slightly sticky, and provides a +2 bonus on Constitution saves VS poison for 1 hour.



\pagebreakNum



### Sinquoi
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

The red leaves of this unusually twisted tree should be burned, and the smoke inhaled. This will have the effect of ‘dilating’ time (making it appear to pass slower.) For every minute experienced outside the influence of the herb, only thirty seconds will actually pass. A single dose is effective for 1d6 hours. Normally used by torturers to prolong agony, the leaves may also be used by people who must think quickly. It does not increase the speed at which a person moves but you may be able to see an opponent telegraph their movements more easily. (DC 20 Dexterity Save when a melee attack is targeted toward you, on a successful save, your AC increases by 2 for the period of that attack.) However, Sinquoi also causes side-effects in the form of halved movement speed for 1d6 hours after the initial dosage wears off.



### Sky Lotus
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

White, stemless flower native to high altitudes that can be found floating lazily through the air between 4 and 15 feet off the ground. Provides 1 day of nutrition if eaten but contains trace amounts of arsenic that can affect creatures that eat a lot of them (DC 5 Constitution save that increases by 1 on each consecutive flower eaten, 2d8 poison damage on a failed save). If oil is collected from 10 sky lotuses, it produces a natural potion of levitation that is also a full dose of poison (DC 15 Constitution save, 2d12 poison damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful save).



### Sleeping Ivy
*[Coastal](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This woody, vine with golden, spade shaped leaves growing in fan shaped clusters of three or five is a true climber, often reaching 30' to 40'. The blooms of Sleeping Ivy are blue-violet colored tufts, or puffballs, which become covered in an extremely fine yellowish powder. A rash of tiny, fluid filled blisters will form on any skin that has come in contact 1-4 hours after initial contact. Despite its "angry" appearance, the inflamed area is not painful and does not itch, but instead will tingle numbly. After becoming exposed to Sleeping Ivy a victim will become more lethargic and harder to wake from sleep. At first the lethargy brought on by exposure may be so slight as to be unnoticeable, but it will increase in intensity each day it goes untreated. On the seventh day of untreated exposure the victim will fall asleep (quite peacefully) and never wake again. To treat Sleeping Ivy, the inflamed area must be bathed in alcohol. The higher the proof, the more rapid the recovery.




\columnbreak

### Sleepweed
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

This plant appears similar to milkweed, and its pods contain sleep-inducing spores. Pods can be thrown as a ranged attack (range 5-ft) and a struck target must make a DC 15 Constitution save or fall asleep for 1 minute.



### Slimmerane
*[Jungle](#p108), [Mountain](#p110), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A tropical, creeping ground vine that has small serrated leaves resembling the leaves of blackberry bushes. Instead of producing blackberries, however, this vine produces small pink berries that can be mashed into a pulp and consumed. Although exceedingly sour, this mixture will grant advantage on the saving throw for the next spell that is cast upon you. Lasts until this spell is cast or 24 hours if no such spell is cast.



### Slumberweed
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Dried and powdered leaves of this blue-green fuzzy plant, if consumed, can cause a sleeplike state that resembles death for 8 hours (Constitution Save DC 13 negates). Can also be turned into a poultice and delivered via blowgun (no Constitution save required to place the victim into sleep if delivered this way).



### Snakespike
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A thin stalk covered with yellow-green flowers. The leaves can be steeped in water to make a tea that, when imbibed 3 times a day, reduces inflammation and restores strength; when made into an ointment, snakespike soothes and promotes rapid healing. (Tea gives 1d4 temporary hit points/day; ointment restores 1 hit point immediately per application but can only be administered to the same character once per short rest.)

### Snapping Grass
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Snapping Grass grows as a clump, or tuft of dark green, dagger shaped leaves, 4" to 6" tall. Six to twelve stalks, each 8" to 10" high grow from the center of this cluster. A pair of hinged, shovel shaped, bright fuchsia leaves, rimmed in spikes sit at the top of each stalk. These stalks sway constantly, as if moved by a gentle breeze. It is unclear how exactly Snapping Grass hunts, but the moving stalks are able to bend, lunge and snap up small creatures with exceptional accuracy. While this plant subsists almost entirely on a diet of small vermin and birds, some adventurers have reported that some clumps of Snapping Grass will lunge and attempt to eat small, shiny or sparkling objects like rings and gems.



### Snowflake Lichen
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Magical plant that looks like snow and grows on rocks in cold climates; it leeches heat from any and and all sources. Within 10 feet of the lichen, the temperature grows noticeably colder. Within 5 feet, the creature must make a DC 12 Constitution save, taking 2d6 cold damage on a failed save. Touching, even with protective gloves or armor, causes 2d12 cold damage on a failed DC 15 Constitution save.



### Snowwood
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A pale tree with a slightly bluish cast to the mottled bark, growing predominantly in the far north. The trunks of the trees are often thin and dense, with spindly limbs and dark green leaves. The mottled coloration of the bark often forms into shapes that vaguely resemble faces, and a few tribes hold a belief that the trees hold the spirits of ancestors that watch over and protect them. The trees are quite remarkable as they can survive in some of the coldest climates, and have even been seen as far north as the High Ice and the Reghed Glacier. The roots of the tree often stretch deep, anchoring the tree in places where other vegetation would find difficult purchase.



### Soarwood
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Rare wood native to Aerenal that possesses magical buoyancy. Water-vessels made from Soarwood cost quadruple price to construct, but move at double speed and are more reliable in rough conditions. Soarwood is 75% lighter than regular wood. It is a necessary component for the construction of Eberron-style airships, and when worked into an airship, it becomes naturally lighter than air.




\columnbreak

### Sparish Nut
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This herb is a powerful aphrodisiac. If successfully administered the DM/PC should act accordingly, but if a method of using dice to simulate its effect is wanted, anyone who attempts to seduce the recipient should have a bonus of +5 to their Persuasion checks for a period of 2d10 minutes.



### Sparkleberry
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A single stalk bearing a number of curled leaves, the sweet berries of the plant are known throughout Faerun, and they sparkle radiantly in direct sunlight. Villagers often know of nearby patches of wild sparkle berries, and pick them in mid-summer. The berries have a variety of methods by which they are eaten. Fresh berries are often served with cheese, and many are processed into jams and jellies to be preserved for later. Consumption of the raw berries grants resistance to Radiant damage for 10 minutes while consumption of the jam or jelly grants the same resistance for 5 minutes.



### Spectreflower
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

This highly unusual plant grows in the deepest parts of dark forests, far from the eyes of civilization. The stalk is a blue-green color, and several pale leaves grow along the length. During nights of the full moon the plant buds a flower, which appears wispy and translucent. Attemping to touch the flower reveals that it is incorporeal, and has the substance of smoke. Come morning the flower disperses on the wind, sending the seeds of the flower on their path. The roots of the flower can be used to make an oil that allows blades to strike incorporeal creatures, called Ghostbane Oil. Using the roots of the Specterflower, alchemists are capable of distilling an oil, that when applied correctly, allows non-magical weapons to inflict full damage upon incorporeal creatures as if they were physical creatures. The benefit lasts only for a few swings, up to the DM’s discretion.

### Spellbane
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

A small but tenacious plant that grows in shadowed areas, clinging to rocks. The wide ragged leaves of the plant are filled with vibrant blue veins, and at night in the spring it produces small delicate blue flowers which crumble with the slightest touch. Surprisingly, the plant has an interesting effect upon magic users and magical creatures. Those that ingest parts of the plant lose the ability to cast spells and gain an increased resistance to magic for 3d4 days.



### Spelleater Ivy
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

An undergrowth plant resembling ivy with a silvery sheen to its leaves, sometimes mistaken for poison ivy. Any spells cast within 20' are absorbed by the ivy. It immediately grows a new 10'x10' section per level of the spell slot used. Direct and unprotected contact with the plant supposedly imbues or causes innate magical ability to surface in non-magic-users and magic users alike, granting a temporary wizard cantrip to the recipient. Eating or smoking the leaves causes astonishing visions and requires a DC 18 Wisdom Save vs Insanity. If collected and dried in large amounts, talented craftspeople can craft anti-magic armor. While helpful, the armor is also incredibly volatile, exploding after absorbing 1d4 spells, releasing all spells and burning the wearer for d8 equal to the amount of spells the armor has captured.



### Spiderbush
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Spiderbush is a small shrub, rarely growing larger than 2' in diameter, with waxy, light green leaves and an exposed woody root system. Tiny blue and white flowers develop on the tips of its branches, blooming year-round. If a Spiderbush does not receive sunlight for a 24-hour period it will use its root system to waddle or shuffle across the ground in search of light. Having stubby, makeshift legs when combined with frequently uneven jungle ground, Spiderbushes tend to lose their balance and tumble through the jungle. Due to their ambulatory nature and need for direct sunlight, Spiderbushes naturally cluster together in clearings or along the tree line near the shore of an island. Periods of extended rainfall have been known to trigger sizable migrations of hundreds, even thousands of Spiderbushes shuffling and tumbling through the jungle in search of the sun.




\columnbreak

### Spiderwort
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This herb will cure poison from any spider bite if applied within 2 rounds. The successful application will negate the poisoned effect and heal the amount of poison damage dealt. This plant may be found anywhere in temperate regions where there is chalky soil.



### Spirit Moss
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A pale white moss that often grows on dead trees in marshy environments. Those familiar with the moss know to avoid it, as it attacks the living. Those that approach within 10 feet cause the moss to violently thrash about, forcing those within the area to make Dexterity saving throws, DC 13, or be grappled by the moss. Escaping the grasp of the moss requires a Strength saving throw, DC 11. The moss then implants spores that burrow into the skin of the trapped creature, inflicting 1d6+1 damage per round. After the creature is implanted, they suffer Disadvantage to all attribute and skill checks, as a terrible malaise washes over them. Once the creature dies, the body sprouts a new mass of spirit moss. The implanted spores can be destroyed by the application of heat to the affected area on the round after implantation, or with a Lesser Restoration or similar magic after that point.



### Spotty Dragonfire
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Wildflower with red, yellow, and orange petals that grows to 1-ft high and stretches 6 inches in diameter. The flower only blooms at night. It can be found in tropical to temperate regions and grows in single plants, except near red dragon lairs, where it glows plentifully. It can be made into Dragongrew, which grants a +1 bonus to all Constitution saves for 1 hour.

### Spring Adonis
*[Forest](#p107), [Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This plant has small green leaves, and wide round yellow flowers. These flowers may be dried, and then eaten. They will then reduce the chance of a heart attack by half each day they are eaten. They may (at the DM’s discretion) also help to strengthen the heart of a person, who through age, injury, or other cause, has a weak heart. Eaten ten or more of these flowers at a time will temporarily raise the Constitution and Strength scores of a person by 1 for 2d12 hours, while reducing their Dexterity by 2 for the same period. In addition to this reduction, the recipient also has a chance of suffering a fatal heart attack 3d12 hours after taking such a massive dose (DC 14 Constitution Save). Certain tribes of barbarians in the mountain regions where this herb is found use the herb in order to help them go berserk in battle. These tribes, due to constant dosing from birth have only a small chance of suffering the heart attack (DC 8 Cons. Save). 



### Stirge Traps
*[Plain](#p109), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

These short plants grow several wide leaves covered in fine hairs, and a single large bell-shaped flower. The flower exudes a sticky sap that is deep red in hue, nearly the color of fresh blood, and also has a coppery aroma. The smell and coloration of the sap is intended to attract predators that prey on blood, such as stirge and giant mosquitos. While smaller insects are trapped by the sticky sap, the leaves are also covered in fine hairs, and when they are touched they curl up, trapping larger prey. Some farmers plant the flowers around the edges of their livestock pens, to keep stirge predation to a minimum, and in more urban areas pots of the sap are left out to trap mosquitos and other airborne pests. The plants are too small to effect people in the same manner.



### Stoneshroom
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Chalky, rock-looking fungus native to the Underdark that is both edible (1 stoneshroom =1 meal) and produces highly oxygenated spores that function as a form of breathable air. Also, for 24 hours after eating a stoneshroom, a creature can hold its breath twice as long as normal. Stoneshroom subsists on minerals in the rock and remains edible for 1 day after picking. With the proper nature check, smaller stoneshroom can be inserted into the nostrils to sustain breathing underwater or through poisonous gas.




\columnbreak

### Stonestream
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

Given the name by gnomes, Stonestream is a small lichen that produces a clear syrupy liquid that then drizzles down the sides of rocks that the lichen lives on. Collecting this syrup and heating into a tea for consumption will turn the user into stone for 2d4 hours. During this time, any poison or toxins, and most diseases, will be purged from the system into the stone surroundings. While turned to stone, the user takes one hit point of damage per hour, and any damage taken as a stone remains after the recipient has turned back from stone.



### Stonewort
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A leafy plant with small pink flowers that grows in bunches in open fields. The plant is rather unremarkable, except for its tenacity and resilience. Farmers will often complain that it chokes out other crops, unless it is pulled up by the root and no remnants of the plant remains, and livestock often refuse to eat it. The true worth of the plant is when it is ground into a powder and turned into a paste. Spreading it on exposed flesh causes the skin to become hardened and stiff, resilient enough to resist slashes and stabs. Grants a +1 bonus to Armor Class for 2d6 minutes. However, more than a single application per day of the paste inflicts a -1 penalty on Dexterity based skill checks and saving throws when applied, as the skin begins to stiffen and become numb.



### Strawberry
*[City](#p107), [Forest](#p107), [Mountain](#p110), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

These small red berries grow on very small ground plants with pale green, rounded leaves. Five berries should be bound into a bandage, which should then be applied to a leper’s sores. If the application is successful, that sore will deteriorate no further. They’re also just really tasty.

### Stygian Pumpkin
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A sulfur-scented, dead-looking variety of pumpkin that can grow in any temperate region and is cultivated by goblins as food. It grows rapidly over large areas, rendering the soil poisonous to other plants. It can be made into Devil's Soap, which is a stinking black paste that grants resistance to fire damage for 1 hour. Can also be combined with Lizuara to create an ointment called Neverdeath that, when applied to the forehead of a recently dead creature, will bring the character back from the dead up to 7 days from its death. If the resurrection ritual is completed improperly, the character becomes an undead. After successful application of the ointment, the character being treated must make 3 death saving throws unbeknownst to the rest of the party:



3 successes or 2 successes and 1 failure will return to character to full health, fully living.

2 failures and 1 success will return the character to conscious undeath, returning the player as a revenant.

3 failures will return the character as a full undead, with the helpful intervention of an evil deity of death, returning the character as a Death Knight with no control over their actions. The Death Knight will attempt to fight, but can also be turned back to the ally as a revenant state if the ointment is applied once more and the Death Knight fails a DC 16 Cons. Save.

### Suaeysit
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

A dark black mushroom with greyish markings along the undersides, this fungus grows in shadowed forests in cool to cold climes. Suaeysit mushrooms can be eaten directly or dried and ground into tinctures or otherwise prepared. The mushrooms give the imbiber a rush of energy, clearing the mind and raising the spirits. However, they are highly addictive, and care must be taken when preparing and prescribing dosages. Often used to counteract shock in emergency situations. (Temporarily adds +1 to all stats – no top limit to natural statistics, but it does not add to magically enhanced statistics – and saving throws, and relieves effects of fatigue. This effect lasts for 1d4 hours, after which the user operates at -1 to all statistics and saving throws, and feels even more fatigued for 2d6 hours. The negative effects of "coming down" can, of course, be counteracted by taking more the drug, with resultant addictive effects of gut-wrenching pain and 5 poison damage per day.)

### Sunberry Bush
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A large bush with light green oval leaves, the branches are studded with small thorns. During the spring months the bush is covered with small golden flowers. The golden berries of the bush grow with small protrusions, giving them the appearance of a small flaming sun. While the freshly cut berries are sour, leaving them to sit in the sun for a day or two after being picked turns them remarkably sweet. The berries are often picked for Sunberry Wine. This wine is remarkably popular with Rangers, increasing the effective range of their weapons by 10 feet and granting them immunity to environmental cold, as well as flushed cheeks.



### Sunflower of Pelor
*[Plain](#p109), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Large sunflower commonly found where undead were destroyed by a cleric’s Destroy Undead. If petals are treated with various oils and solvents, the petals can be consumed to bolstering spells relating to the creation of light, doubling spell effect area.



### Surane
*[Coastal](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A tall, hardy reed capable of growing up to 10’ tall, found mostly along salty and brackish water in colder climates. When mixed with oil and left to sit for a period of three days, the resulting mixture can be applied to the neck and will allow the character to breather underwater (and only underwater) for 2d4 hours.



### Sussur
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A rare, magical and magic-dependent tree with long gnarled branches and banyan-like aerial roots found in the largest Underdark caverns. Grows to 60 ft in height, has very few leaves, and absorbs magic, creating massive (1d20 x 100 ft.) anti-magic fields.



\pagebreakNum



### Suth
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A tree with dark grey bark, and branches which sprout almost horizontally from the trunk for some distance before abruptly changing angles. The branches of multiple trees growing close together often grow together, becoming a tangled mass, and sometimes creating natural walls. The olive-green leaves are long and fluffy, but sport a spike at the end which often makes attempting to push through the interlaced branches a painful task. The wood of the tree is renowned for being hard and durable, making the process of cutting them down very difficult. Thus, in some areas where lumbering has cleared away large swaths of trees, there are large copses of tangled Suth trees left untouched. When the trees have been cut down, however, it was found that they work wonderfully as shield-wood, especially since soaking it in water before battle keeps it from catching fire.



### Swampwalker
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A curious plant that has caused more than a few strange tales from the rural villagers, the Swampwalker seems to stand out of the water, supported by a mass of tendrils, and sprouting a clump of pink flowers that attract various insects. Each tendril is the thickness of a finger, and due to slow currents in the swamp, the tendrils often clump together or break off entirely, causing the plant to look like a looming figure standing on the surface of the brackish water. One legend has it that the plants come alive during the darkest of nights. They stalk nearby villages hoping to catch the unwary and drag them back to watery graves. Whether this is true or not is completely unknown.



### Sweet Arcane
*[River](#p111), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A short river grass found alongside rivers and other bodies of water in humid, tropical environments. When this grass is ground into a cud with honey, the resulting decoction is a syrupy sweet treat that will allow spellcasters to memorize and prepare one extra spell per day. The level of the spell is determined by the number of grass used (12 stalks per level), and can only be of a level for which the caster has slots. Last 1d4 days.

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A succulent plant with a cluster of three broad and thick leaves that grow from the ground, and sprouting a single small blue flower on the tips of each leaf each spring. The swordstalk often grows in tropical places, and often in the sandy soil near beaches and deserts. The broad and heavy leaves of the plant are often severed and dried, and the result is a fairly resilient weapon with a jagged edge on either side, capable of cutting through flesh almost as easily as a steel sword. The resulting weapon functions as either a short sword or a longsword, perfect for the discerning druid. However, on any critical fail on a roll to hit with the swordstalk, that the weapon is broken and rendered useless.



### Taggit
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A family of rare plants, closely guarded where they grow in any number, with oily, deep-green leaves in the shape of stars growing from a central woody-stemmed bush. These oily leaves can be steeped in hot water to extract an oil, that when applied via contact in large quantities, acts as a paralytic that was previously used for surgery until its use as a poison for the torture and assassination of a powerful king several decades ago. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw vs. poison or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is paralyzed and unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage but remains paralyzed except for the movement of their eyes.

### Tai-Gi
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

The ground and powdered root of this small, almost-flat plant will, if eaten, increase the efficiency of all a person’s five senses by 5 times for a period of 2d6 hours. They will be able to see five times as far, and things five times as small, track by scent alone, hear the smallest sounds, and even taste many poisons on their tongues, granting double advantage on perception rolls for any sense. A side effect is that they are also five times as susceptible to pain. (For each hit point of damage, the person must roll under their constitution minus damage taken. For example, if someone with a Constitution of 15 was hit for 6 points of damage, they would have to roll under 9 on a d20. If the person ever takes more damage than their Constitution score while under the influence of this herb, they have an 80% chance of instant death, just from the pain.)



### Takara Bulb
*[Forest](#p107), [Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A large bulbous mass that grows a half-dozen shoots, each ending in a single, large leaf. The bulb is dark brown or even red in coloration, while the leaves are a light green with red veins. During the spring a single large red flower forms at the center of the bulb. The bulb can be harvested and eaten raw, although it often tastes better after having been cooked. Many small mountain villages cultivate the bulb, as the plant grows well in rocky soil. (Heals for 1d4-1 hit points if eaten raw or 1d6+1 hit points if cooked).



### Tamarind
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

This low-hanging tree fruit will quench the thirst. However, it does not replace the water in their system. A person can still die of thirst, they just won't feel thirsty. Because of this fact, its use can actually be quite dangerous.



### Tamariske
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

This herb will cleanse the body through the wounds, removing all disease in the form of black ooze that will drip from open wounds. If no wounds are open at the time, the ichor will instead ooze from the tear ducts, giving the Tamariske its nickname. It does not cure lost hit points.

### Tangara Kelp
*[Ocean](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Growing out of the seabed, this dark-green rope-like kelp grows in shallow sea waters near coastlines and reefs and is both a blessing and a bane to sailors. The kelp often tangles oars, fishing nets, crab traps, and rudders. However, more than a few sailors stuck in the doldrums near a desolate island have survived off of little more than the purified water contained within the kelp’s stalks and barrel-like fruit, as well as the schools of fish that dwell among the fronds.



### Tangled Waybread
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A soft, flowing, amber grain on a flexible stalk that grows in large patches in the middle of open fields. The grain often blows violently even in a low breeze, and will tangle up in itself, creating giant mats of grain that then slowly dies due to cramping and underwatering. The grain can be ground and turned into a meal that, in turn, can be mixed with water and baked to create a simple but filling flatbread.



### Tansy
*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Tansy grows in small patches of 1 to 3-foot stalked plants with yellow button flowers. Commonly grown in cities outside of homes and personal properties, Tansy has traditionally been used to keep away flies and pests. According to legends of old, Tansy comes from the word “athanasia” which means “immortality,” and the use of this word for the flower relates to a tale of monks reading about local flora and a story about a hero of yore, Brandalier the Brave, in which the ruler of Brandalier’s kingdom states “Take him hence, and when he has tasted immortality let him return to us,” referring to this flower, or something similar.



### Taran'ka
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

\pagebreakNum



### Tateesha
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

The Tateesha bush is a low-lying shrub with long thin leaves and small brown nuts. These nuts may be chewed to provide a short-lived feeling of euphoria, and are mildly addictive. They have the side effect of staining the teeth, making it easy to find a tateesha addict. The flowers, called silks, bloom only in spring, and if gathered and dried for one week form a powerful narcotic which may be smoked. For 2d10 minutes after smoking, the persons’ insight skill is increased by +2, but for 1d4 hours after this, a state of distortion ensues, and the recipient’s Intelligence and Wisdom drop by -2 from their normal levels. Prolonged use causes the user to collapse into an almost dreamlike trance. The drug is highly addictive, and after only two uses, the user must make a DC 16 Cons. Save or become addicted, with a +1 to the save DC after each dose from here on out. Addicts lapse into the dreamlike trance stated above until their next exposure to the drug or until cured of addiction.



### Tekkil
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A succulent swamp plant with fat red leaves, which when chewed, function as an analgesic drug. Initially no effect, but after a few minutes, the user becomes almost entirely fearless, gaining +5 to Wisdom and Intelligence Saves against fear, and becoming immune to the Frightened effect for the next 1d20+10 minutes. Drug also grants a -5 penalty to all Dexerity saves for the next 1d4 hours. Overdose occurs with a second dose during the original duration and causes halved movement speed for 2d4 hours as well as the negative Dexterity side-effect.



### Tempin
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A bushy climbing vine with tubular yellow flowers, the leaves and flowers of tempin can be boiled and made into a poultice that will draw out poisons from bites and stings and allow the wound to heal cleanly and without complications. (When poultice is applied within 1 round of taking poison damage, the recipient may make an extra Cons. Save vs poison to avoid the Poisoned effect. Also grants +1 hit points to recovery hit dice expended during every short rest for the first 2 days after poultice is applied.)




\columnbreak

### Tephrosia
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Tephrosia consists of a small woody stem, with fern like leaves along its length, and the plant is topped by several small flowers (or in summer, seedpods). Either the flowers or the seeds may be boiled in water and then drunk to calm the recipient. This is very useful when a person is delirious, or otherwise insane. It also has a mild pain-relieving effect and may be given to the slightly wounded. The seedpods are more effective than the flowers and may also be dried. This herb is mildly addictive and should be used with care (DC 11 Cons. Save, addiction causes mild insomnia, turning long rests into short rests).



### Terbas
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

The leaf of this plant must be applied to the site of nerve damage or consumed to fix brain damage. If successful, the rate of healing for such damage will be doubled on each day of use.

Slimy white tuber with a bitter taste, native to shaded, sandy ground in temperate climates. After chewing it for one minute a creature is granted +10 temporary hit points and then only regains health while resting as if under the care of a healer for the next 12 hours.



### Thalsen Weed
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A tough yellowish stalk that grows stiff triangle shaped leaves, the weed is despised throughout the Dalelands to Cor Myr. Some believe the weed to have been magically created, as it grows from seed to mature adult in a matter of days, often seeming to appear instantaneously. Once the weed reaches maturity, it produces a small cluster of white flowers. The petals of the flowers are coated with a dusty powder that causes a slight rash if it comes into contact with the skin. These petals are sometimes picked to create Itching Powder (When coming into contact with bare flesh, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw, DC 13, or begin itching for the next 2d4 hours, or until the powder is washed off.). The rapidly growing weed is said to overcome crops nearly overnight, choking out carefully planted fields, and destroying months of work. Most livestock also refuse to eat the weed, with the exception of goats. Thus, many farmers that live in areas where Thalsen Weed thrives also keep a small number of goats that they let wander in the outer edges of their lands.

### Thanalayla
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A long stalk covered in small thorns and ending in a thick bulb, the plant hangs down from the branches of other trees. Thanalalya is a predatory plant, the stalks have their roots embedded in branches of trees, yet they cause no harm to their host tree. The plant instead secretes a sicky resin that smells musky and attracts insects and small birds. Smaller insects are trapped in the resin, while the stalk curls around birds that would be capable of breaking free of the resin, gripping and impaling them with the thorns. The resin slowly dissolves the prey, providing nutrients to the Thanalalya. The Thanalayla, according to wives’ tales, also wards off lesser fey and this may be the case because pixies can also get caught in its sticky resin.



### Thelmallow Flower
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A floating plant that inhabits marshes and swamps, the plant produces wide, waxy leaves that arc minutely out of the water, which are often the haven for mosquitos. The plant also buds large pale flowers with ragged petals that attract swamp flies. Grinding up the flower creates a paste which, when combined with paste made from Vaundyr Vine, is used to create Spellslayer wine. Although the wine is quite refreshing, tasty, and light, it also reduces the magical ability of spellcasters, causing a permanent decrease to the amount of spell slots available at a given level (at the DM’s discretion).



### Thimbleweed
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A spiky, medium-length grass that grows in patches in areas of direct sunlight. As summer turns into fall, the tips of the grass begin to swell and turn into white, thimble shaped flowers.

These fibers can be turned into a silken fabric by elves that can be worked into armor to make it easier to move in, increasing AC by 1 and increasing movement speed by 5 feet. Crafting with thistledown requires master leveling training from an elven craftsperson or a nature check of 25+.



### Thornapple
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This is a small ground hugging plant. Its seeds are about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and are covered in small thorns. A single seed is very effective as a minor pain reliever.

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Thyme can grow up to a foot in height. A small, ornamental evergreen, Thyme has tiny dark green leaves. In spring it has many sweet scented mauve flowers. The smell is so strong that the herb is often smelt before it is seen. These flowers must be dried and then mixed with fresh, clear water to produce an antiseptic lotion. This lotion can then be applied to infected wounds. Aside from its common uses, Thyme is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.

### Tickleweed
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Although Tickleweed grows as a thick, grass-like carpet of cylindrical dark green leaf-blades, 3"-4" in length, resembling typical grass, its actions set it apart. Unlike normal grasses, Tickleweed prefers to grow on nearly vertical surfaces and will even thrive in dark places, assuming there is ample moisture. The cylindrical leaf-blades are highly sensitive to even the subtlest shifts in ambient temperature, so they move and shift continually. Tickleweed stretches towards increases in temperature and away from decreases. Each leaf moves independently causing the plants to appear to ripple and shiver with waves. Even the simple act of walking past a patch of Tickleweed will trigger a flurry of movement. Tickleweed bloom very rarely with circular flowers of red or white with a central black "eye". The flowers are prized by alchemists as they amplify concoctions related to detection, reaction, and rapid or fluid movement (up to DM’s discretion).



### Torchstalk
*[Forest](#p107), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Non-magical mushroom that can serve as a torch. Takes 1d4-1 minutes to ignite, but burns for 24 hours shedding bright illumination in 10 ft radius. Has a sub-species that explodes into choking spores after 30 seconds of burning, requiring anyone within 20 ft to make a DC 15 Constitution save to negate 1d10 poison damage. DC 18 Nature allows differentiation between the two types.



### Torment Toadstool
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Large blue mushrooms found in swamps all over Faerun, most people are careful not to step on the toadstools. Some villagers purposefully propagate and harvest the mushrooms in order to make a particularly earthy tasting ale. Those that step on the toadstool cause it to rupture and release a cloud of spores within a 5-ft radius. Those that inhale the spores must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated while vomiting for the next minute.



### Trathua
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A thick black vine that grows along the floors of caves and caverns and subsists on the nutrients leftover from the meals of Giant Spiders.

### Troll Poppy
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A bright blue poppy flower commonly used to bribe trolls for safe passage through a monster-filled area. Trolls go wild for these flowers and will eat them as soon as they lay eyes on them. Usually found in large patches in open fields, 2d8 flowers can be harvested per 5 foot by 5 foot area. In addition to their use with trolls, the petals of troll poppies can be dried, crumbled, and smoked. When smoked, user will not be able to rest or sleep for the next 6d4 hours. During this time, the user can never lose consciousness unless dead, not from exhaustion, magical sleep, or poisons. After this period has passed, the user falls unconscious for 1d4 hours.



### Trueroot
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

A legendary sapling that is said to have been accidentally created during a series of experiments involving the repeated grafting of various magically enhanced roots onto treants, from which seeds were planted to create saplings that were then grafted with each other and so on. The trueroot saplings are said to have pulled magical energy from an unknown place, and this magical energy could be channeled into other plants to accelerate their growth to be 10 times faster, or be channeled by spellcasters to give perfect health and “almost limitless spellcasting”. The trueroot died after small cuttings were taken to propagate it and there have been no known successes in recreating it.

### Twilight Birch
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

The bark of this tree is a pale white, and quite smooth. The leaves of the tree are small, waxy and dark, and spend the day curled tightly, only to open at night. During colder months the tree sprouts small purple flowers that blossom at night. Legend says that the trees first erupted from the ground during a fight between an avatar of Shar, and an avatar of Selune. During the fight the avatar of Shar was wounded, and where her drops of her blood fell upon several saplings, they were forever changed. It has been noted that the trees were once found more commonly in places where the Shadow Weave was most prominent. The wood is soft and flexible when first cut, but hardens over the course of several days, allowing craftsmen to work easily on freshly cut wood to easily create ornate pieces. Once hardened, the wood retains the shape it was crafted into. The wood is often used to create furniture such as elaborately carved chairs, tables, and desks. Additionally, the wood is used to crat intricately detailed scepters, wands, and staves, and a wooden weapon made of Twilight Birch is said to do extra damage to celestials (+3 force damage to successful against celestials). In addition, when a magical item is crafted using Twilight Birch, and used to cast a Death or Trickery Domain spell (even if used by non-Clerics), it allows the spell to be cast one level higher without using a higher-level spell slot. This ability can be used once per long rest, and only at night.

A small, white fungus consisting of only mycelium with no reproductive bodies, Tyrant’s Mercy is a slow-moving fungus that grows mainly on decaying woody matter. When harvested and mashed with a small amount of mercury, the resulting paste is sticky and white with a slightly pearlescent sheen. A contact poison, the paste is often applied to locations that the victim’s flesh would commonly be in contact with, such as sword handles, the insides of crowns and hates, or even on the lids of toilets, repeated exposure may cause the target to slowly lose their mind. Upon each contact, the target must make a DC 10 Cons. Save against poison. Upon 3 consecutive failures, the target then rolls on the Short-Term Madness table (DMG pg. 259). After this initial mild insanity, and more contact with the poison, another 3 consecutive failures will cause a Long-Term Madness effect (DMG pg. 260), and another 3 consecutive failures after that will cause an Indefinite Madness (DMG pg. 260).



### Tyrant's Sword

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

This hardy plant grows on the seaward side of many cliffs, looking out over the ocean. The vine clings to the rocks, and the broad fluffy leaves gather moisture from the wind. During the warmer months, the plant lowers, producing long, sharp yellow petals tinged with crimson on the edges. Tea made from the flower petals is highly sought after, as it includes a wide variety of medicinal uses. Some nobles believe that drinking a single cup of Umozokai Tea a day ensures longevity.



### Ur

A tall, woody-stemmed flower that grows during spring and summer months. The blooms are almost a foot across and a bright crimson red. The inside is filled with a large quantity of nectar, making the flower very popular among a large variety of birds. During the fall, as the plant starts to die in cooler temperatures, the nectar begins to spoil and take in bits and pieces of disintegrating plant matter which turns the nectar into a thicker, foul-smelling salve that can be applied to regenerate a lost limb or body part. The regeneration cycle takes 3 full days. There is a 10% chance the limb will be mutated in some manner



### Vaundyr Vine
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A thorny, thin vine that grows in wetter areas such as swamps and jungles. The waxy leaves are ground to create Alarvaun, a component for Spellslayer wine along with Thelmallow Flower.

### Verdant Goeleth
*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

This wine has the strange side-effect of allowing the drinker to hear the thoughts of anyone in a 5-mile radius of themselves that has been drinking Woebegetter Wine in the past 6 hours. This can be really useful if you're trying to coordinate a silent attack, and it can be dreadful if the people you're attacking are also drinking Woebegetter Wine, but keeping their thoughts mute so that you don't know that they know what you're doing. The effects last for 1d20 minutes per cup.



### Vinuk

___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

If this herb is wafted under the nose of an unconscious person, it will immediately awaken the person.

### Violet Slime
*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Lurking on the surface of stagnant pools of water deep in the marshes, this slime is deadly to those that are caught unaware. Noticing the shimmer of violet indicating the slime lingering on the surface requires a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) skill check. While entering the pool the slime remains inert, but once the victim emerges from the pool, the slime clings to them. The slime becomes highly corrosive when removed from the pool and inflicts 2d6 acid damage per round until it is washed off with water or exposed to bright light or fire. The corrosion only damages organic material, thus ignoring metal armor.



### Viper's Bugloss

___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Viper’s Bugloss is a blue flowered stalk plant that is found growing invasively in open fields and on farmland.

Powder drug made from a tiny purple flower that grows on graves of Rallaster worshippers, Initial +2 bonus to Intimidate and Cons. Saves against fear for 1d4 hours. Secondary effect of -4 penalty to Persuasion and Deception for 2d4 hours. Overdose if additional dose within 4 hours of the first ingestion DC 15 Constitution Save or Petrified.



### Vortax
*[Other](#p112)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Other](#p112)

A secret guarded closely by ancient sects of druids around the realm, vortax is a green powder made from a plant of the same name. This powder must be held in the hand of a druid and burned, causing 3d8 fire damage to the druid, making druids that constantly use vortax easy to pick out. After the vortax is burned away, the druid’s hands will start to glow a faint green. The druid can, as an action, conjure up a powerful thunderstorm within a mile radius area, and command any target to be struck by 5d20 lightning damage with no saving throws. This effect lasts for 1d4 minutes.

### Waredan
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A surprisingly hardy dwarf tree that grows about 5’ or slightly less. The hard, waxy leaves of this tree can be combined sugar water in a boiling process to yield a concoction that, when injected into the bloodstream of a lycanthrope, will cause the lycanthrope to be unable to change form for 12 hours, even in the presence of magic that would cause this change instantaneously, like the spell Moonbeam.



### Watercress
*[River](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A very small, leafy green that is commonly eaten in salads or as an added green in many meals. Eating this green in combination with a day’s rations will replenish one hit die if consumed separately from a long rest. Aside from its common uses, Watercress is one of the plants mentioned in the Nine Herbs Charm, which is supposedly capable of curing any poison or disease.



### Waterorb
*[Coastal](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Bulbous aquatic fungus that grows in boulder-like patches in some seaside areas and tidal pools. Can be used a source of fresh drinking water near the ocean.



### Waxtree
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

Waxtrees have large, fuzzy, almost white leaves that grow in bunches at the ends of twisted, dark brown, woody branches that are 1-3 inches thick. While most commonly growing to a height of 2-3 feet, some Wax Trees have been known to grow as large as 8 feet tall. A shallow and spreading root system robs nearby plants of food and moisture causing these trees to be found with few neighbors, even in areas of otherwise dense vegetation. The branches, if broken, ooze a translucent purple, viscous fluid that smells vaguely of citrus. The wax burns cleanly and evenly making it a good alternative to beeswax, and alchemists often seek it out as a foundation for magical glues and thickeners. Exceptionally skilled alchemists are able to use this wax to create a putty that can *permanently* change the shape and structure of facial features. The would-be master of disguise should be cautious however as minor, even accidental, tweaks to this formula will create a putty that causes organic matter (like faces) to dissolve and melt away in a matter of seconds.

### Waxworm
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A strange and small plant that is often found growing on rotting logs and animal droppings, the plant lacks much of a root system. The leaves are small and curled around the flowering part of the plant. Once the plant reaches maturity, the leaves fall away to reveal tightly curled pale flowers that appear to be large maggots to the untrained eye. Birds often eat the flowers, thus spreading the seeds far and wide. Grinding the flowers into paste and boiling them produces a waxy substance which woodworkers can use to seal their work from moisture. Painters also seek out the substance, as it causes the colors to resist fading over the years.



### Weeping Tree
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A species of deciduous tree that closely resembles oak, the weeping trees are often left alone while other nearby trees are cut down to use as timber, as strong superstitions surround the tree. One tale speaks of a nature demigoddess long since forgotten being banished to inhabit the trees after losing a fierce battle for dominance of the nature domain with Kalancha. Another speaks of a powerful druid sacrificing herself to save the forest, and her ghost living on within the branches of the weeping trees. During autumn the trees begin losing their leaves and begin dropping their seeds, which is what creates the sound the trees are known for. Each seed has a small petal, which is shaped in such a way that when it falls it creates a sound similar to a person softly crying. As the trees often grow in clusters and they drop several thousand seeds each, over the course of a few weeks in autumn it sounds as if the trees are constantly weeping.



### Weirwood
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Rare oak-like tree with leaves that are a silver-sheen brown on top and velvet black on the underside, often protected by Dryads and Treants. Can grow huge and many-branched, will not burn from non-magical fire, and imparts a warm clear tone to musical instruments made from it. It can replace oak or holly in any spell, and living Weirwood has quadruple fire resistance (no means to preserve this quality after harvesting is known). Weirwood within the illumination radius of a magical light source emits light as a candle for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area.




\columnbreak

### Werasa
*[City](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A short, leafy bush that produces small lilac flowers on the spring solstice. 2d8 flowers can be harvested from a single bush, and the petals of these flowers can be crushed and sprinkled over food to preserve the food for 1 week. There will be a faint trace of generic flower-like notes in the taste.



### Whistling Cactus
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Growing on the edges of the desert are these pale green cacti with long yellow spines. The cactus grows as a single cylindrical body, and when moisture is abundant the cactus will sprout several purple flowers near the top. After the flowers wither and fall off, they leave deep holes in the surface of the cactus. When the desert winds pass over these holes, they resonate at an unusual frequency that creates an eerie sound that can be heard for over a mile. Many nomadic tribes will avoid areas near the cactus, believing the plants to hold the souls of the damned that howl for eternity.



### White Byrony
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This climbing vine has greenish-white star shaped flowers, each bearing five petals, and has green berries which turn red when ripe. It has a root, something like a huge turnip, and this root should be ground up and boiled in water and drunk as a cure for pneumonia. In addition, the berries are commonly collected to make Byrony Jam, a staple of breakfasts in the norther climes. 



### Whitecandle
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A tall, flowered plant with silvery-green leaves. When the flowers are mixed with water or wine and applied directly to a wound, they act as a painkiller. (Grants 1d4 temporary hit points to an injured target immediately, but these points are lost as the effect wears off in 2 hours. Further applications before the previous one has worn off are ineffective.)



\pagebreakNum



### Wild Fireclover
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Brilliant orange-red summer-flower found in temperate plains and farmland. Crushed petals give of a lovely smell for 1 week. The stem can be made into a substance called Mindfire, which when added to an ingested poison, imposes a -2 penalty to Cons. Saves to those who fail a save against the poison, and forces casters to make concentration checks (DC 15 + spell level) to cast spells.



### Wildwood
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A flexible wood that can be worked into armor (counts as masterwork, +1 AC, Dex +1, negates stealth disadvantage on heavy armor styles). Wildwood heals a point of damage over 24 hours if exposed to sunlight for at least 1 hour, or, heals 5 points if also left to soak in water for 8 hours. Cost is double that of ordinary masterwork equivalent, but crating time is unaffected, and crafting requires craft (woodworking).



### Willow-Herb
*[Plain](#p109), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

The plant grows to about three feet in height. It has long hairy leaves and large purplish-pink flowers. The smoke of this herb will keep away snakes and other minor vermin. One dose burns for about five minutes.



### Winclamit
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

Each Winclamit tree bears but one fruit per year, resembling an apple the size of a watermelon at the precipice of the tree. When this fruit is eaten it will restore 1d100 hit points to the recipient. The fruit can be stored for up to 2 months in a dry sealed container.



### Windwhip Tree
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Growing in small clumps in vast open plains, the tree grows straight up until it splits into thousands of willowy branches. Each of these branches are thin and whip-like, and are covered in small clumps of light green leaves and small red thorns. The bark of the tree is dark brown with lighter brown spots around the base of the tree. 

When the wind blows across the plains, the flexible branches and trunk bend far over. 

When the wind suddenly abates, the trunk abruptly snaps back into place, and the flexible branches make a popping noise not unlike the crack of a whip. This also causes the tree to fling their seeds far and wide. While the springiness of the wood makes it unacceptable to use for most construction, it has been quite popular in the construction of ballistae.



### Wispstalks
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

This incredibly rare fungus has become something of a fable among herbalists. It is reported to have a large, translucent-blue bulbous cap growing atop a thin stem, and to normally form in small clusters deep within damp cave environments and forests. When consumed, the recipient first takes 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 15. Cons. Save to keep it down. On a successful save, the recipient will gain the secondary effect of the wispstalk, becoming transparents but not invisible for 1d8 minutes; on a failed save, nothing happens except for the recipient coughing up what part of the fungus they tried to get down.



### Witchweave Palm
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A single Witchweave Palm Tree is comprised of three to five trunks, 10" to 12" in diameter, that grow in tight clusters and can reach 25' to 50' in height. The fronds of a mature Witchweave are approximately 3' long before splitting into 7 to 10 pale green leaves with drooping, fibrous tips that grow for another 2' to 3'. It is the numerous white fibers, resembling hair, appearing in the splits of the leaf tips that give the Witchweave its name. These leaves are prized by the Lizardfolk natives of the Swordfish Islands who harvest, dry and process them into rope and rough cloth. The Witchweave blooms with small yellow flowers that give way to oblong, reddish fruit about the size of a human thumb. If the fruits are dried, wrapped in fresh green Witchweave leaves and burned, a thick, deep blue smoke with a sweet, musky odor is produced. This smoke acts as a potent anesthetic to exposed flesh, and the Lizardfolk are known to fill tents and lodges with it for both medical and spiritual reasons. It is rumored that some of the Lizardfolk's powerful shaman are able to refine the fruit of the Witchweave even further to create potent healing salves and unguents, but if true, these secrets are highly guarded.

### Witchweed
*[Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A plant whose leaves and stalks can be refined into a paste, which is then rolled into a smoke-stick of sorts that creates 10 ft cube of light smoke (no concealment) that forces casters to make a concentration check as if casting defensively or lose focus on the spell due to bouts of uncontrollable sneezing. The smoke is effective for 30 seconds.



### Wittlewort
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Herb with green gossamer-like fronds which, due to its rapid growth cycle, is found only in the spring in temperate, subtropical or tropical areas. Deters slugs and other pests. If powdered, it can be made into Wittlewort brew, which grants those under Charm effects another saving throw (if the effect allowed one).



### Wizard Hats
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A small conical mushroom that grows in the Underdark. The stem of the mushroom is pale white, and the cap is generally light orange to dark ochre in color, and sometimes covered in spots. Drow often collect the mushroom, as even though it is bitter while it is still fresh, cooking the fungus over an open flame causes it to shrink and take on a surprisingly meaty flavor. Some underkdark-dwelling chefs send out foraging parties to harvest the mushroom so that it can be prepared for feasts.



### Wolfsbane
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

This small (15-cm) plant has black green leaves, sawed deeply several times, and three flower stalks with tiny white flowers and brown seed pods. The flowers can be crushed into dust and carried in the pocket to have the effect of granting a +2 on a Constitution saving throw vs poison to avoid lycanthropy. The protection lasts for 2d4 x 10 minutes and makes tracking from lycanthropes harder. In addition, the seeds can be consumed (DC 20 Cons. Save) to fully avoid the repercussions of lycanthropy.



### Wolfweed
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Similar in appearance to Wolfsbane, this plant can be made into a substance called Journeyman Serum, which provides a +2 bonus on constitution checks to avoid damage from a forces march




\columnbreak

### Wood Sorrel
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This is a small plant with leaves in three parts, like a shamrock. The flowers are bell shaped and are white with a dash of blue. The leaves must be crushed and dried for two weeks before use. This herb keeps people cool. It is obviously invaluable in desert regions. It doubles the person’s ability to endure heat effects, but does not counteract dehydration, etc.



### Woodrose
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

If steeped in wine and the resulting wine mixture drunk, this herb causes people to become very merry. Anyone who wishes to resist its effect can do so, if they make a DC 19 Cons. Save vs poison.



### Wormwood
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

The effects of this herb last for two hours. During this time the character is granted +10 temporary hit points and can function beyond the point of exhaustion. Wormwood normally grows to about four feet in height. It has a stiff and angular stem, reddish brown in color. It has deeply incised smooth leaves which are silvery white with a slight tinge of green. It has small, yellow-green flowers arranged in long spikes at the top of the stem. The herb is also a rather effective insect repellent and is often left with clothing to keep fleas away. It also makes a very effective antiseptic when mixed with Rue (Intelligence check to remove all infection from a wound within 5d6 hours, healing an additional 2d6 during the next short rest to whoever the antiseptic is applied to). In addition to its above effects wormwood is also a prime ingredient in a very dangerous, very addictive drink called Absinthe which is milky green in color.

### Xitluchi
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A twisted bramble of branches, growing small clusters of stiff pale leaves, and covered in sharp thorns, the bush grows deep within jungles and forests. The roots of the bush are often exposed to the air, and are a favored nesting place for snakes and small vermin. Legend has it that the demi-god Finder Wyvernspurn was once walking through the forest, draped in a fine robe made of gold stitched fabric sewn with threads of silver. Passing along, the robe was caught by a particular bush, tearing the robe and causing it to spill some of Finder’s creativity into the wind. Becoming angered by the action, Wyvernspurn cursed the bush, causing it to transform into a twisted mockery of what it once was, and to be covered in thorns. Consumption of the leaves in a pale tea leads to vivid and guiding dreams for 1d4 days afterward.



### Yagdav Bush
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A rather robust bush covered with waxy stiff leaves, the Yagdav is prominent in the north, and sometimes used as topiary decoration. During the warmer months the bush grows small yellow flowers. The flower petals are often dried and ground to make a tea that promotes fertility to couples that are having difficulty conceiving. The female is instructed to drink the tea every morning upon first awakening.



### Yaran
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

The pollen of this flower must be inhaled. A successful roll means that a person’s sense of smell and of taste are doubled for one hour (advantage on perception checks for this period of time). The herb must still be growing or have been cut in the last 10 minutes.



### Yarpick
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A type of tree that grows small fruit whose seeds are nourishing both whole and as ground meal. The fruit are protected by long, thin, razor-sharp thorns approximately 3 inches long. These thorns have use as sewing needles, blow-darts, and as miniscule daggers perfect for doll hands.




\columnbreak

### Yarrow
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

The small white flowers of this herb, which cluster at the top of its one to two feet tall straight stem, should be crushed and applied to wounds. If successfully used it will stop minor bleeding, and reduce major bleeding to the minor level. A second application can then be used to stop the minor bleeding. According to legend Achilles used yarrow to treat wounded Greek troops during the Trojan War. The successful application of Yarrow grants an additional +4 to hit points regained during a short rest.



### Yavethalion
*[Mountain](#p110), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A small, groundcover shrub that sprouts tiny yellow flowers in spring which then turn to tiny yellow berries during summer months. 2d20 berries can be harvested from one plant. When the fruit is eaten, it will restore 1d4-1 hit points to the recipient. Yavethalion keeps for only two weeks.



### Yazur
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

Resembling a wild grape in tropical climates, yazur is a small purple berry that can be eaten outright, by anyone but a spellcaster, and tastes like sour apples. If a spellcaster eats yazur berries, the caster will lose a highest-level spell slot until the next long rest. Yazur can also be mashed into a paste with sugar. Applying this paste to any magic object will drain any magic abilities from it, and reverting the object to a normal, non-magical item in the process. If the paste is then eaten after absorbing this magic, it will heal the character to full hit points. In addition, the yazur plant can also be used against spellcasters in a tactical attack. When a spellcaster is directly injected with juice from the berries, all spells that the caster has memorized and prepared for the day will be obliterated from their memory.



### Yew Tree
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A tall, evergreen tree found in old growth forests, Yew have long been held sacred by druids as a symbol of death and rebirth, as dropping limbs of older trees will sometimes yield new sprouts. In addition, the yew has come to represent especially death since a poison can be prepared from yew needles and berries if soaked in oil under a full moon (3d6 poison damage to the recipient with no save). 



\pagebreakNum



### Ylam Tree
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

Found in many deserts, the Ylam Tree is a short, stout evergreen that survives on very little amounts of water and maintains its internal moisture using a thick red sap. Imbibing a sufficient quantity of this so-called 'Ylam Blood' or ‘Blood of Glory’ induces a frenzy of aggressive emotions which are especially strong in the heat of battle, leading to a berserk rage. Combatants under the influence of the blood of glory gain a +1 to hit and +2 to damage, but suffer a -3 penalty to armor class, due to the reckless abandon induced by the fluid for 2d6 hours after consumption.



### Young Lad's Love
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Young Lad's Love is a 3 to 5-foot-tall shrub with many branches that resemble small trees. It has small yellow-white flowers, and green feathery leaves, which smell of lemon. These leaves turn a rich orange-brown in late autumn. The flowers should be crushed and placed into a poultice to be used. A successful application will cure one small area of frostbite, such as a foot or hand, in 2d4 hours.



### Yuzine
*[River](#p111), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A rare mushroom that only grows while fully submerged in freshwater, Yuzine is occasionally sought after and harvested by high ranking clergy of Omir and Olim, the Gods of Life and Death respectively. When powdered and combined with holy oil by a trained professional, Yuzine becomes Metabolite, a sort of tranquilizer for the undead. An undead creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. Lasting for 30 seconds on a failed save, an affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted. A creature affected by this poison makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it. On a failed save, the poison's saving throw DC for the next save attempt decreases by 10.

### Zalanthar
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Also called blackwood or darkwood in the North, the bark of the tree ranges from the color of pitch to a dark ash. The tree itself is actually comprised of an extensive root system, from which a number of trunks sprout to the heavens. While the trunk and branches are extremely dark, the leaves of the tree are pale grey and white, often giving the branches an appearance of glowing in the moonlight. The trees are often harvested for their precious darkwood, which has the sturdiness of other hard woods, but is favored because it only weighs half as much. Darkwood weapons and shields are often very light and worked only by the most skilled of craftsmen (shields made of darkwood grant +2 AC and +1 to stealth checks made while holding the shield), both properties that cause such goods to be quite expensive. Wizards of the South favor darkwood when constructing rods, wands, and staves. Since Zalanthar requires masterwork, it requires training or high knowledge of nature in order to effectively craft with.



### Zulsendra
*[Arctic](#p107), [Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

When this pale green and grey mushroom is eaten, it doubles a person’s rate of movement, and rate of attack (2 actions per round) for three rounds, as well as also imposing advantage on rolls to hit. At the end of that time the person must make a DC 18 Cons. Save versus poison or collapse in exhaustion for 1d6 turns.



### Zur
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

This lean and stalky, pale yellow fungus must be brewed for six hours in water harvested from an underground stream. A successful nature roll for the beverage’s preparation means that a person’s senses of smell and of hearing are doubled for one hour. (Advantage on perception rolls based on smell or hearing.)



### Zurkhwood
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Giant 30-40 ft high mushroom. Has large spores that can be eaten as bread if baked properly, and its hardy stalks serve as an Underdark substitute for wood.
