*[Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

A tough plant that grows on the edges of swamps, the stem grows symmetrical pairs of stiff oval leaves. During warmer months the plant blossoms into violet flowers. The large roots of the plant can be ground into a powder and is the main ingredient in a potion that allows other people to see into other realms, often referred to as Sight Beyond. For the next hour after drinking, the vision of the character shifts to the Astral Realm. They may perceive what happens from a position that corresponds to their location in the Material Realm. During that time, they are blind to everything that happens in the Material Realm, including combat.



### Abyssal Blackgrass
*[Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Thick black weed native to the Underdark that propagates via tiny seeds. On the surface it appears as 1-foot diamater clumps, but its roots extend in a 50 ft diamater just beneath the surface. Natural healing is prevented when standing above its roots, and magical healing only heals half the normal HP. If the clump is pulled out, the plant survives and regrows the clump in 1d4 days. Only digging up the whole root system or the use of a Blight-type spell can truly kill it. Has taint-mechanic boosting effects.



### Acacia Tree
*[Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A tall tree growing in warmer plain environments with large, sharp thorns on the branches and small, oval shaped leaves. The acacia has long been associated with rituals surrounding the burying and preservation of the dead, and as well as in rituals designed to contact and speak with the dead. If acacia is combined with a solution of melted iron and poured into the hand of a person who is has recently died, the time period in which Raise Dead works is increased to a period of 30 days instead of 10.



### Acai Berries
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Small, blue berries that grow in bunches on tall pines in tropical forests and beaches. The berries have been used for several hundred years in wine and preparation of food in times of plague. The berries grant resistance to catching most kinds of disease and can help in the curing of disease.




\columnbreak

### Adamant Algae
*[Ocean](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Rare algae that grows in water gathered around adamantine. Produces dark red liquid that doubles natural healing rate for 24 hours (requires 1 ounce per 100 lb of body weight) meaning that hit points regained from expended hit dice during a short rest are doubled and the amount of hit dice recovered during a long rest is doubled. Typical pool contains 32 ounces of the liquid, which becomes useless 30 minutes after removal from the pool unless stored in an adamantine vial (200 gp), which makes it last for 1 month. 



### Adder's Tongue
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

The herb has one leaf which grows from a stalk about three inches from the ground. Its appearance gives it its name. The leaf must be boiled in olive oil and set in the sun for three days. At the end of that time the infusion can be used as a balm for wounds. In the event that the wound is infected the balm will draw out the infection within one day. However, for that one day the damage caused by the infection will be twice as severe, infection damage can be determined by the DM. If the wound is not infected the balm will increase the rate of healing by 1 hp for that day, adding +1 to any hit points regained during a short rest.



### Adgana
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

The leaves of this plant must be dried. They may then be crushed and eaten. Its effects diminish with constant use. The first time and second time Adgana is used it adds 2 to the user's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution for 2d4+4 minutes. The third time it is used it adds 1 to Strength and Dexterity for the same amount of time, the 4th time +1 is added to Strength only, and after that no benefit is ever gained. In addition to this, the herb is also highly addictive, meaning that after the first and second used, the user must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or become addicted. This DC increases by +1 for each additional use, and addiction causes a -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until next consumption of Adgana.

### Aeglos
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A tall, slightly thorny plant with a large, white, sweet-smelling flower and a strong root system. When boiled in salt water, the roots can be used as a combat stimulant. When a creature drinks the infusion, at the beginning of their next turn they gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class if they are wearing no armor or light armor, which lasts for 3d10 minutes. This herb has no effect when used again on the creature until the creature completes a short rest.

Alchemilla is a fairly uncommon ground cover plant, used sometimes as an ornamental on the property of the wealthy. The plant has ornate, cup-like leaves notable for catching and collecting beautiful beads of dew, and its small yellow flower that blooms in the late summer. According to legend, alchemists of old used to harvest the drops of dew and rain that would collect on these leaves for use in alchemical processes of turning base metals into gold. Although this is no longer common practice, Alchemilla is still commonly used as a tea or herbal supplement to help with feminine health.

___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

\pagebreakNum




### Alil
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A succulent desert plant that sprouts small pink flowers with a center filled with large black seeds. Alil can be chewed or smoked, and induces a brief cataleptic trance wherein strange visions may be experienced. In addition to these recreational effects, alil has a tendency to awaken latent psionic ability, which leads to it having a certain degree of popularity among adventurers. Any player character experiencing the alil trance must make an Intelligence check on 1d20. A roll of under or equal to the character's Intelligence indicates that the drug has activated a previously unknown part of the character's mind, and he gains a random psionic ability until the next long rest. 

| d10 | Psionic Ability |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | Temporary intelligence bonus of +1. |
| 2  | Precision Mind: you become skilled at reading your foes. With this capability, you can call upon your gift to strike with increased accuracy. You add your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) to an attack roll, after the roll, but before the announcement of the result. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). |
| 3  | Immunity to psychic damage. |

| 8  | You may, as a bonus action once per combat, instantly deliver a massive assault on the thought pathways of any one creature, dealing 1d10 points of psychic damage to it. |
| 9  | You heal another creature’s wounds, transferring some of its damage to yourself. When you manifest this power as a full action in combat, you can heal as much as 2d10 points of damage to an ally by taking half of this damage to yourself. |
| 10 | You may gain proficiency in one extra skill until the long rest or proficiency with one tool or instrument for 1d6 days. |

### Allathorne
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Growing in the cold north, this scraggly and thorny bush endures extreme hardships, and only blossoms for a few short weeks during the year. The sparse leaves of the plant are large and waxy, and point upward toward the sun. While some of the bush remains above ground, the majority of the plant is an extensive root system that spreads far and deep beneath the earth. Brewing the dried root into a strong and bitter tea creates a drink that staves off the cold, and is a much sought-after drink in the harsh climate of the Dalelands, granting a +1 bonus on any saving throws against cold weather or cold based damage for the next hour.



### Alligator Teeth
*[Mountain](#p110)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A rough bush that primarily inhabits rocky regions, and grows to about the height of a man and similar in diameter.

The cactus is covered by tapered yellow thorns, often giving the cactus an appearance of having a golden aura. In the cooler months, the cactus sprouts clusters of small white flowers. Tapping the water contained within the cactus and distilling it over a period of months creates an interesting tasting wine. Those drinking it say that it tastes fruity, but with a touch of something they can’t quite place. This wine is often called “Angel Wine,” and is sold by Shaarmid merchants throughout Faerun. Whether or not the “touch of something else” comes from tainting from the merchants or is an innate flavor of the cactus is yet to be decided.

Standing between 6 and 8 feet high, with glossy leaves and twisting, contorted branches, the Ashvein Tree is most notable for its thin, papery bark. New growth leaves on an Ashvein begin as a light blue-grey that slowly darkens into a rich charcoal, giving the trees a distinctive pattern. After the bark reaches a certain age it begins to crack and peel away from the trunk. If the dark grey bark is boiled in water for three hours, then dried and crushed, it creates a powder that completely neutralizes the flavor and odor of anything blended with the bark as it is crushed, possibly making the plant appropriate for use with poisons or perhaps just bad tasting food. Wood from the Ashvein is exceptionally light weight and releases large amounts of acrid smoke when burned.

An Aspen leaf placed under the tongue while sleeping is thought to make the bearer more eloquent. And to some, Aspen has long been a treatment for fears and apprehensions when applied as oil extracts. Whether or not any of this is true is debatable, but some will put superstition before what the can see as proof.

### Balon's Plant
*[Desert](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

Growing close to the ground in areas with minimal water, the plant only sprouts a trio of wide, thick leaves which spread outward to absorb as much moisture as possible and provide as much shade to the sandy soil below as possible. Below the sand the root system delves deep to find hidden reservoirs of water that are not evident on the surface. Also known as “bread of the desert”, this plant develops large spherical fruits nearly the size of a man’s head. These fruits have a tough and leathery exterior, but when cut open, the fruit has the consistency of fluffy bread or cake. The seeds of the fruit are quite small. Each fruit contains enough nutrients to sustain four people for a day. Unfortunately, farming the plant seems to be near impossible. The seeds must be within a medium-size creature when it dies, at which point the release of certain gasses causes the seeds to mature and greedily absorb as much moisture and nutrients from the corpse as possible. This rich bounty allows the plant to develop a strong root system.
