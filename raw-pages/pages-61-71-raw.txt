### Hiexel
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

This tree has silvery-green bark covering a sparse collection of branches which curve upward to support vibrantly green leaves which turn dark red in autumn. The wood is an odd hue of green, and unfortunately not dense enough to be useful in construction. However, burning the wood creates a large quantity of smoke, which is often used to smoke meat or to create signal fires (or to create clouds of smoke that can be used for escape and distraction). The bark is useful after rendering it down to create a thick green paste which is often sought after to seal buildings against the cold winds of winter.



### Hiljirat Pepper
*[Forest](#p107), [Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

A small plant that has many branches, each which end in a single triangular leaf, the peppers that also grow on the plant are much sought after for their spice. The peppers are either dried or ground into powder after being picked, allowing them to be shipped afar with little chance of spoilage. The wealthy of the cities of the Sword Coast enjoy the taste of the peppers, and several sailing merchants pay exorbitant amounts to have the peppers harvested and shipped.



### Hoggle Beans
*[Arctic](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A single leafy stalk with a tough exterior that grows in gentle rolling fields of the Dalelands, the plant produces numerous pods upon reaching maturity. Within each pod are small pink beans, each one almost perfectly spherical. Most large herbivores, such as cattle and goats, avoid the plant, as it has a detrimental effect. Herbalists and healers often seek the plant out because the beans are a strong laxative, requiring a DC 15 Consitution saving throw after being ingested to avoid the unpleasant effects.



### Horehound
*[Plain](#p109), [River](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

This plant has angular greyish stems and grows to a height of three feet. It has oval shaped tooth edged, ash green leaves. It has small creamy white flowers which group at the base of the leaves.

### Iazutl
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

Growing in clusters, the flower has a long stalk, which has a single oval leaf at the very top of the plant. The leaf points toward the rising sun, and blows in anything more than a light breeze. During warmer months, the plant blossoms numerous small crimson flowers. Those that venerate Kiltzi speak tales of the Iazutl flower. One tale speaks of the plant growing singularly, and without flowers, and when Kiltzi noticed the plant was all alone, she wept. Her tears caused several similar plants to grow in the area, and as an expression of their love for her, they sprouted an abundance of flowers. Lovers often gift the flowers to one another, as a sign of their affection. The flowers are also typically presented to the bride by the groom on the night before the wedding in Sword Coast wedding ceremonies.

The plant is only seen during the summer months, when there is considerable sunlight, and in winter months it withers and dies. Beneath the surface of the snow, the iceflower has an extensive root system that grows very quickly. The roots are durable enough that some of the northern tribes will dig them up to serve as a foundation for a roof over small circular huts. In addition, some nomadic tribes of the Dalelands have found that by placing iceflower roots under the armor, soldiers have found that they will be immune to overheating and gain +1 AC.

### Jelly Moss
*[Jungle](#p108), [Plain](#p109), [Underdark](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

It is said that when a representative of the Martel Company brought the first samples of Jelly Moss back to Banuvo's College of Mysteries, it nearly caused a riot among the academics. The resident sages were unable to conclusively determine if this clump of grayish-purple tube-like structures, smelling a bit like rotten pears, was a plant or a fungus. It was known that Jelly Moss, when crushed, becomes very messy and sticky, but until an unlucky professor sat a small sample of Jelly Moss that’d been left on his chair, no one had realized this goo would create an almost instant, permanent, bond of incredible strength with wood. The battle of classification rapidly transformed into a full-blown war between the Blacksmith's Guild and the Carpenters over the future of nails.



### Jinab
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Rare](#p115)

### Juniper
*[City](#p107), [Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

The Juniper tree can grow up to ten feet in height. It is an evergreen, which has prickly stiff foliage. The berries appear in early summer, but take roughly three years to ripen to the stage where they are useful. Unripe berries are green, ripe ones are bluish-black in colour. Because of this rather long period of ripening, it is wise to never denude a tree of berries. A normal sized tree will have between 100 and 200 ripe berries. 15 of these berries should be crushed and mixed with boiling water. When the liquid has cooled, the infusion should then be drunk in order to relieve status effects temporarily (3d4 hours). This liquid will only keep for a month under normal conditions, but can be mixed with an alcoholic spirit to increase its lifespan indefinitely. According to the traditions of some northern nomads, a sprig of juniper kept in a house would protect the inhabitants from vampire attacks. This may actually work at the DM’s discretion.



### Juxi Root
*[Plain](#p109)*

The pears can be eaten normally and taste refreshingly of citrus mixed with apple. However, the seeds of the King’s Pear can be crushed and distilled with alcohol to draw out the seed’s poisonous compounds. The resulting solution is a milky white color and smells slightly of cooked meat. After ingestion, the recipient must make a DC 15 Cons. Save vs. poison. On a failed save, the target begins to experience headaches and visual/auditory hallucinations, and the target takes 3d8 psychic damage and loses one point from wisdom. On a successful save, the target takes only have the psychic damage and has no secondary effect. The resulting hallucinations often cause the recipient to see things twist and warp into the shapes of vile and hideous monsters, seeking to cause them harm.

This rich liquor is sought after for its taste and smell. When a character imbibes Korogg Liquor, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save. The liquor quells freethinking: no person who drinks it need make an Investigation check while under its influence for the duration of a day, as the result will incur a -8 penalty since they can’t think of anything their investigation might mean, and the consumer takes a -1d6 penalty to wisdom checks after consumption until the next long rest.

### Krakaem Pods
*[Jungle](#p108), [Swamp](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Growing off of tree branches, at first inspection this fungus appears to be the cocoon of an insect. The fungus is intrusive, sending tendrils into the tree branches and stealing water reserves. Sporadically another pod will emerge from the tree branch, swell to the size of a human fist, and then burst, sending a cloud of black spores floating on the wind. The spores are a severe irritant and may even cause temporary blindness if a large mass of spores get into the eyes of a creature (DC 12 Constitution Save if within 15 feet of the tree). The pods are also sought after for food, as frying them in oil and serving them with fish is a delicacy served in Waterdeep.



### Kylathar
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Legendary](#p116)

Anyone who eats the yellow, soft, plum sized fruits instantly has two random stats exchanged; Strength with Constitution, Wisdom with Dexterity; anything is possible (the DM should determine which statistics are exchanged). There is no saving throw, and no cure (DM’s discretion). Eating more of the berries will simply cause more stats to be randomly exchanged. Short of magical storage, the fruits will spoil and rot within 2 days after plucking. The bush itself grows about 2 meters high, with long, dusty green leaves, which are slightly sawed. The flowers grow in groups of 4 to 8, and are yellowish white with orange edges. The flowers grow in late spring, the fruits are ripe in autumn.



### Laishaberries
*[Forest](#p107), [Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

Laishaberries grow on dark green, knee-high bushes. The leaves of the bushes are hard and waxy, and stay on long into autumn, sometimes even into winter. Concealed under the leaves, the red, cherry sized berries grow in spring and early summer, developing from small, fragrant, wax blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The berries taste quite bland themselves, although they can be used to add a special taste to all kinds of jellies. When ripe, the berries can be eaten raw, and will each heal 2 hp of damage, or speed the recovery from most diseases. However, they will also render the eater mute for 20 minutes for each berry eaten. Also, if more than 5 or 6 berries are eaten at a time, a DC 12 Cons. saving throw vs poison is required to avoid severe and somewhat debilitating stomach cramps that will incur a -2 penalty to Dexterity saves and checks for 1d3 hours. A jelly made from the berries themselves loses both the healing and silencing powers (and the danger of cramps) of the fresh berries, but the curative effects for most diseases is doubled; fresh berries reduce the recovery time by one day for each berry eaten, the jelly halves the total time.

### Lakeleaf
*[Coastal](#p107), [River](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Uncommon](#p114)

Parsley-like herb descended from plants growing on the shores of large rivers and oceans. If crushed and rubbed onto meat, that meat never dries out regardless of how overcooked.

### Land Caltrops
*[Jungle](#p108)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A spiky groundcover plant avoided by beasts because of the small, thin thorns that sprout from the plants that, with enough force, become embedded in an animal’s paws. The leaves can be carefully harvested and crushed into a poultice. If applied to a venomous bite or injury poison within one turn, it will draw out the poison, healing 1d4 poison damage and removing the poisoned effect if applicable. 



### Larnurma
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

This tree has round purple fruit, which are about the size and consistency of plums. When eaten this fruit will heal 2 hp per fruit. These fruits cannot be dried and will rot within two weeks of picking. However, the juice of three fruits can be mixed with olive (or other vegetable) oil, and left to stand for a week. This oil has an almost unlimited life. Rubbing this oil into the recipient’s skin will ease muscle pains, and also restore 1d4 hit points, but may only be used once per short rest to utilize these effects.



### Lashar
*[River](#p111)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Common](#p113)

A grey, slightly slimy lichen that grows on rocks in the middle of streams. When ground up into a slurry and consumed, it will slow the effects of poison for 2 hours, resulting in half damage taken from poisons in that time and putting off the poisoned effect until the slurry works its way through the body. After that the poison will resolve normally, unless another potion is drunk. The slimy concoction is very repulsive, and a DC 14 Constitution saving throw is needed to see if the imbiber can actually hold it down.

### Laspar
*[Forest](#p107)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Common](#p113)

A squat evergreen tree with dusty green bark, and olive-green needles that grow in clusters, most people avoid burning the wood of the tree. Setting the wood ablaze resulted in a large number of sparks, which potentially could set houses ablaze, due to the high amount of pitch contained within the wood. The needles, which grow in “shags” at the end of each branch, are often used in special torches which burn for 2 hours. The needles are also often burned simply for the deep piney aroma they provide.



### Latimer Orchid
*[Plain](#p109)*
___
- **Rarity:** [Very Rare](#p115)

A yellow-orange orchid flower commonly farmed and sold illegally. The pollen of the flower can be turns into a sticky, rich-smelling powder that can be applied to the gums and tongue. When consumed in this way, it brings about a mild hallucinatory state for 4 hours, wherein the recipient's capacity for visualization and imagination are increased. The powder is used recreationally by many, including by those of an artistic bent, but it is members of the Illusion school of magic who benefit most from its effects.
