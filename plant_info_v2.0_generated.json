Each fruit contains enough nutrients to sustain four people for a day. Unfortunately, farming the plant seems to be near impossible. The seeds must be within a medium-size creature when it dies, at which point the release of certain gasses causes the seeds to mature and greedily absorb as much moisture and nutrients from the corpse as possible. This rich bounty allows the plant to develop a strong root system."

High priced entertainers often burn small pieces of the wood, which creates leaping blue flames. The leaves and sap are often ground in the creation of a vivid blue dye that is used to dye clothes in the North, and often in the creation of inks for tattoos. One pirate fleet that has plagued the Sword Coast in recent years is notorious for their crews bearing frightening looking blue tattoos covering their faces."

The berries are slightly sweet and quite tasty, but have a strong effect on mammals: those who eat them fall asleep. The berries have this effect on mammals only (with half effects on half-mammals like half-elves and the like), but a single berry is enough to bring down any man sized or smaller mammal, and given enough berries, even the greatest mammal will fall asleep. There is no saving throw, although the sleep caused is quite normal, and a sleeping creature can simply be awakened.

When she was revived from the brink of death, the mistletoe was then turned over to the domain of Sune, the goddess of love and she vowed that whenever anyone passed under a branch of mistletoe they would kiss to illustrate that mistletoe had become a symbol of love and not of hate."

Legend says that the trees first erupted from the ground during a fight between an avatar of Shar, and an avatar of Selune. During the fight the avatar of Shar was wounded, and where her drops of her blood fell upon several saplings, they were forever changed. It has been noted that the trees were once found more commonly in places where the Shadow Weave was most prominent. The wood is soft and flexible when first cut, but hardens over the course of several days, allowing craftsmen to work easily on freshly cut wood to easily create ornate pieces. Once hardened, the wood retains the shape it was crafted into. The wood is often used to create furniture such as elaborately carved chairs, tables, and desks. Additionally, the wood is used to crat intricately detailed scepters, wands, and staves, and a wooden weapon made of Twilight Birch is said to do extra damage to celestials (+3 force damage to successful against celestials). In addition, when a magical item is crafted using Twilight Birch, and used to cast a Death or Trickery Domain spell (even if used by non-Clerics), it allows the spell to be cast one level higher without using a higher-level spell slot. This ability can be used once per long rest, and only at night."

A shallow and spreading root system robs nearby plants of food and moisture causing these trees to be found with few neighbors, even in areas of otherwise dense vegetation. The branches, if broken, ooze a translucent purple, viscous fluid that smells vaguely of citrus. The wax burns cleanly and evenly making it a good alternative to beeswax, and alchemists often seek it out as a foundation for magical glues and thickeners. Exceptionally skilled alchemists are able to use this wax to create a putty that can *permanently* change the shape and structure of facial features.

The monk sat under this tree and meditated for close to seven years, surviving only on the tree\u2019s collected water droplets and on the tree\u2019s bounty of figs. After learning of this monk\u2019s quest for enlightenment, a corrupt king wanted in on this understanding of everything and wanted it only for himself, and ordered the tree destroyed. The roots were hacked at with swords and glaives and major limbs felled with large axes. All the while, the monk sat beneath the tree and still meditated. When the king\u2019s servants had finished their destruction, the monk retrieved a bottle of sacramental wine from his bag and fed it to the tree\u2019s damaged roots, vowing that if the tree should die, so would he. Upon the completion of this vow, the tree\u2019s roots absorbed the wine and began to repair themselves at an incredibly rate, and the tree grew larger and lusher than it had been before. The location of the original tree has been lost to the ages, but cuttings of the tree have been transplanted to many of the major monasteries of the realm as a symbol of divine power and belief."

While a single chain will usually run for 20' to 50' and spread to cover an area of about 200 square feet, some vines are purported to reach 100' or more and cover thousands of square feet with their leaves and thorns. The thorns of Poznan's Chain secrete a virulent poison that causes internal organs to violently rupture and hemorrhage (DC 18 Cons. Save. On a failed save take 6d8 poison damage and the poisoned effect for 6 hours, and on a successful save take half as much damage with no secondary effect.), leading to a bloody death in as little as 20 to 30 seconds. Curiously, if this poison is collected and taken more than 5' from the vine it immediately becomes water. Some claim that Poznan's Chain can produce large, silvery, metallic, star-shaped blooms, but these reports have never been verified."

Many rural children enjoy picking them and weaving the flowers into their garments, which then jingle as they run and twirl. There is also a legend that the sound of the flowers ward off evil spirits, a legend that is partially true. Any fiend must make a DC 15 Wisdom save vs. fear in order to approach within 10 feet of the fairy bells or anyone wearing them."

Very rare due to its slow growth and limited growing conditions, False Unicorn Horn has a rich history rooted in folklore. Supposedly, the root used to possess not only extremely beneficial healing properties, but extraordinary magic. This so angered some greater demons, that they sent an army of lesser demons to uproot and eat as many of the roots as they could, and this rage was so powerful that to this day the roots have not been able to fully grow back. The remaining tuberous stub is still imbued with good medicine and every spring it is able to put forth the tall spike of magic-imbued white flowers as a reminder that the power of good can always avert the forces of evil. (Consumption of this root will heal the recipient for 2d6+2 hit points, and make the individual invisible to demons and infernals for 1d4 hours.)"

Any negative effects of exhaustion already being felt will evaporate for 1d8 hours.

The pollen of the flower can be turns into a sticky, rich-smelling powder that can be applied to the gums and tongue. When consumed in this way, it brings about a mild hallucinatory state for 4 hours, wherein the recipient's capacity for visualization and imagination are increased. The powder is used recreationally by many, including by those of an artistic bent, but it is members of the Illusion school of magic who benefit most from its effects. Due to the greater precision and depth of imagination produced, all illusions created by one under the influence of the yellow powder gain a boon to their typical effects, be it increased save DC\u2019s, increased damage, or increased defensive properties. The yellow powder is not addictive, but it can lead to a detrimental state of internalization and paranoia. Any session where a character uses the yellow powder, he must make a Wisdom check on 1d20. A roll of above their Wisdom score results in an episode of paranoia some time during the session (at the DM's discretion)."

They may then have an aphrodisiac effect on anyone the recipient attempts to influence in the next 1d4 days (+1 to persuasion checks made within that period). In addition, if dried, the leaves may be sprinkled among books, and will then act as an insect repellent. These make the leaves highly prized among mages and sages who will normally pay between 12 and 15 gp for small amounts of the dried leaves."

In addition, the recipient will also have lowered spell component costs for spells involving nature and plant growth, or that target plants and animals. Harvesting too much of a bed at the same time will cause the bed to begin to rot as the bed is actually a single organism that spreads deep into the earth."

The roots of a Dripping Tree spread and twist through the ground almost as far as the branches above. Numerous cream-colored spheres, 10\" in diameter, that cling to the branches are the source of the tree's name. Special nodules on the roots of this tree detect movement, warmth and pressure causing the globes directly above the triggered area to fall. The globes are filled with a viscous, sticky mucus and burst on contact, causing creatures hit with them to stick to the Dripping Tree's root clusters (DC 18 Dexterity or Strength Save to avoid grapple). When pressure is constantly applied to an area of roots, the branches above it begin to slowly drip a sticky, acidic, digestive mucus onto the area below (1d6 acid damage per hour).

Some farmers plant the flowers around the edges of their livestock pens, to keep stirge predation to a minimum, and in more urban areas pots of the sap are left out to trap mosquitos and other airborne pests. The plants are too small to effect people in the same manner."

Each tendril is the thickness of a finger, and due to slow currents in the swamp, the tendrils often clump together or break off entirely, causing the plant to look like a looming figure standing on the surface of the brackish water. One legend has it that the plants come alive during the darkest of nights. They stalk nearby villages hoping to catch the unwary and drag them back to watery graves.

An undead creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw.

On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

When broken open, the plant will ooze a black ichor that when injected directly into the bloodstream brings back characters from unconsciousness, catatonic and even comatose conditions. There is a 1% chance for each day over a week, that the recipient will slip back into their original state and that this plant will not work on them again."

The Grammax also floats on water, often spreading across the surface of underground puddles and stagnant lakes, hiding the actual depths. The Grammax reacts rapidly to the presence of flame or high heat, quickly shrinking away while expelling any trapped gas. This action of the escaping gas makes an odd shrieking sound that is akin to the sound a screaming child makes. While it is a barely palatable prospect, the mold can actually be consumed as a source of food for those lost and desperate enough (at the cost of a level of exhaustion when consumed by any race except for goblinoids). Oddly, goblins seem to enjoy the taste of the mold, and often scrape it up as a renewable food source. "

The poison can be applied to any surface, adhering to it until it comes into contact with organic matter, which it quickly seeps into. It is clear, nearly invisible, and odorless, but can be easily identified by agitating the liquid in any way, which causes it to flash violently with varying hues of light. Due to its use in bringing down many nobles in past generations, it has been banned in nearly every established civilization. Being caught with it on your person is akin to an instant death sentence and one can only learn of its nature by asking the right person. Ask the wrong person, and you may find yourself put to death. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poisoned creature feels no immediate effect and is unaware of their condition. After a week, the creature gains an effect listed on the short-term madness table (DMG pg. 259). When the short-term effect ends, they gain an effect from the long-term madness table (DMG pg. 260). When the original long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term effect as well as an indefinite effect (DMG pg. 260). After each long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term and indefinite madness effect until they die or are cured. This effect can only be cured by a greater restoration spell cast at 7th level or higher."

        "Description": "A secret guarded closely by ancient sects of druids around the realm, vortax is a green powder made from a plant of the same name. This powder must be held in the hand of a druid and burned, causing 3d8 fire damage to the druid, making druids that constantly use vortax easy to pick out. After the vortax is burned away, the druid\u2019s hands will start to glow a faint green. The druid can, as an action, conjure up a powerful thunderstorm within a mile radius area, and command any target to be struck by 5d20 lightning damage with no saving throws. This effect lasts for 1d4 minutes."
